In answer to Manrico's puzzled question about his identity, she assures him that he is indeed her own son - the horrible memory caused her mind to wander and she did not know what she was saying. She reminds him that she has always loved him and has just nursed him back to health after he was wounded in a battle against the count's forces. The battle had taken place just after the duel in which Manrico had spared the count's life, as a voice from heaven seemed to command him. Azucena urges him to strike without hesitation if the occasion arises again.\nA message is brought that Leonora, believing Manrico dead, is about to enter a convent.

The duke tells Borsa about a beautiful girl who has caught his eye in church, but to whom he has not spoken. His attention is caught by the appearance of the Countess Ceprano and he expounds his philosophy that all women are alike; he can give his heart to one as readily as another and constancy is a bore. His approaches to the countess are frustrated by her nervousness of her jealous husband, until the hunchbacked jester Rigoletto distracts the count and allows the duke to slip off with the countess.\nIn Rigoletto's temporary absence Marullo has a bit of scandal to tell: he has discovered that Rigoletto has a mistress. Rigoletto enrages Ceprano by his lack of subtlety in suggesting to the duke that he dispose of the jealous husband by cutting off his head. The courtiers are tired of Rigoletto's tricks and gibes and plan to be revenged on him.\nMonterone bursts in demanding to be heard. Taunted by Rigoletto for his concern about his daughter's lost honor, he curses the duke and Rigoletto - to the superstitious horror of the latter.\nScene 2: A street with Rigoletto's house on one side and Ceprano's palace on the other\nBrooding on the curse, Rigoletto is accosted by Sparafucile, a killer for hire, offering his services and (like the courtiers, thinking that Rigoletto keeps a mistress) pointing out that Rigoletto has a rival. Rigoletto dismisses him, but takes note of where he may be found if needed. He reflects that he is no better than Sparafucile, who kills with the sword, as he does with his tongue. A deformed man, forced to amuse others for his existence, he blames the duke and the court for his own wickedness.\nOnly in his home is he another, better man. He tenderly embraces his daughter Gilda. He evades her questions about his life and family, remembring the dead wife who had loved him despite his deformity. He tells Gilda that she is everything to him and is terrfiied when she begs to be allowed to leave the house. He summons her duenna Giovanna and instructs her to look to his daughter's safety\nHe goes outside to investigate a noise and the duke slips in and hides, throwing a purse to Giovanna to ensure her silence. Having found no one, Rigoletto bids his daugther farewell - to the surprise of the duke, who had been unaware that Gilda was his jester's daughter. Gilda confesses to Giovanna that she feels guilty that she has not told her father of the handsome young man she has seen at church. She muses about her love for the stranger, but is alarmed when he suddenly emerges and professes his love. He calms her fears and she admits to her love. He tells her he is a poor student called Gualtier Mald\u00cb. Hearing sounds outside he leaves and she reflects on the name of her beloved as she prepares to go to bed.\nIn the street the courtiers are planning her abduction. Rigoletto, unaccountably nervous, reappears and they pretend they are carrying off Countess Ceprano, enlisting his help to hold the ladder, after blindfolding him. It is only when they have broken into his house and carried off Gilda that he tears off the bandage and realises what has happened, blaming Monterone's curse for his misfortune.\nACT II\nA room in the duke's palace\nLike Rigoletto, the duke had gone back to the house to find Gilda gone. His concern for her convinces him that this time he is really in love. The courtiers describe their exploit to him and he soon realises it is Gilda they have carried off, and rushes to comfort her with the revelation of his true identity.\nWhen Rigoletto comes in search of Gilda, the courtiers feign indifference. Realising that she is with the duke he first abuses the courtiers, then begs them to restore his daughter. As she emerges in a state of disarray from the duke's bedroom, he orders the courtiers to leave. Gilda tells him about the young man at church and about how she had been abducted, though making no reference to what has occurred just now. Rigoletto comforts her and promises they will leave Mantua. Monterone, led by on his way to prison, laments that the duke is still untouched by his curse. Rigoletto swears that Monterone will be avenged by him, as Gilda pleads in vain for mercy.\nACT III\nA tumbledown inn in a deserted spot on the banks of the River Mincio\nRigoletto has brought Gilda to Sparafucile's dwelling in an effort to convince her that the duke, whom she still loves, is faithless. They watch as, after proclaiming his belief in the fickleness of women, he makes advances to Sparafucile's sister Maddalena, who, while pretending disbelief in his extravagant protestations, is not indifferent to him. Rigoletto sends Gilda home to change into men's clothes and set off for Verona, where he will follow her the next day. Sparafucile collects half his fee - the rest is to be paid when he hands over the duke's body at midnight.\nGilda returns as a storm begins, and listens as Maddalena pleads with her brother to spare the duke - even insulting his professional pride by suggesting he murder his client, Rigoletto, instead. He agrees that if anyone arrives before midnight he will kill him instead, and Gilda determines to sacrifice herself for the duke. She knocks on the door, is killed and her body thrust into a sack and handed to Rigoletto when he returns.\nRefusing Sparafucile's offer of help, Rigoletto exults in his revenge, only to hear the duke singing in the distance as he leaves. Tearing open the sack, he discovers Gilda on the point of death. She begs his forgiveness for disobeying him, explaining that she is dying to save the duke.

She has an answer to all his accusations, but he is not convinced and says he will lock her in her room when he goes out. Almaviva bursts in, disguised as a drunken soldier.

She is reading, watched by Nemorino, who loves her but is too shy to approach her. Adina tells everyone that she has been reading how Tristan, pining with love for Isolde, drank a love potion which caused her to fall in love with him.\nArriving to a drum roll at the head of his soldiers, Belcore gives Adina a bouquet and proposes marriage, confident that no girl can resist a soldier. She declines the offer, and the jealous Nemorino wishes he could approach her as confidently as Belcore. Adina offers wine to Belcore and his men.\nNemorino plucks up the courage to speak to Adina of his love, but she answers that she is capricious and wishes to remain free, advising him to go to the city and live with his rich, ailing uncle. He is unable to accept her advice to love lightly as she does.\nScene 2: The village square\nHeralded by a trumpet, the quack Dr Dulcamara arrives, promising potions to cure all ills. Nemorino asks if he has Queen Isolde's elixir and Dulcamara, at first puzzled, recovers and pretends to have just the thing. He sells Nemorino a bottle of the elixir - actually wine - with instructions to drink it slowly. By the time Adina arrives, Nemorino is sufficiently drunk and elated with the prospect of her imminent surrender to love to be able to ignore her. She is piqued, but decides that the harder he tries to break the chain, the stronger it will be. She flirts with Belcore and agrees to marry him in a week's time, hoping to provoke Nemorino, who, however, is confident in the power of his elixir.\nWhen Belcore receives orders that he and his men must move on, he persuades Adina to marry him that night. Nemorino begs in vain for postponement of the wedding till the next day, by which time he expects the elixir to have taken effect, but Adina is determined to torment him and Belcore brushes him aside. Everyone except Nemorino accepts an invitation to the supposed wedding.\nACT II\nScene 1: Inside Adina's farmhouse\nEveryone except Nemorino is celebrating. Dulcamara produces a new duet which he sings with Adina. It tells of a girl who refuses a rich suitor because she loves a poor man. When the time comes for the signing of the contract, Adina is annoyed that Nemorino is not present. When the others have danced out, Nemorino approaches Dulcamara, explaining that he cannot wait till the next day for the elixir to take effect. Dulcamara advises another bottle, but Nemorino has no more money. When Belcore learns of his problem, he explains that he will receive cash immediately if he enlists. He does so, to the amusement of Belcore at having enlisted his rival.\nScene 2: A courtyard\nAdina's friend Giannetta tells the village girls that Nemorino's uncle has died and left him a large fortune and they all flock around him. Not yet aware of the news, he attributes his sudden popularity to the elixir. Adina is angry at his apparent desertion of her and Dulcamara wonders if he has accidentally hit on the real elixir of love. When he explains to her that Nemorino had bought the elixir from him to win the heart of some unfeeling beauty, Adina realises that Nemorino really loves her and is remorseful at her treatment of him. Perceiving that she loves Nemorino, Dulcamara decides that she needs a dose of the potion to bring him back to her, but she assures him that she needs no elixir other than her own beauty, which Nemorino is powerless to resist.\nNemorino has seen tears in Adina's eyes and believes she will soon be his, but pretends to be indifferent, telling her he is unable to choose between the village girls clamoring for his attention. She tells him that she has bought back his freedom from the army because he is needed in the village, but is reluctant to admit to her love until he announces that he will still become a soldier if she does not.\nBelcore soon recovers from his rejection, declaring that there are lots more fish in the sea.

He is being shown over their future house on a hill overlooking Nagasaki Harbor by the marriage broker Goro, who has provided the house as well as the bride. They are joined by the American consul, Sharpless, and Pinkerton explains that both wedding contract and house lease are for 99 years, terminable at any time at short notice.\nPinkerton finds this arrangment very convenient, as his philosophy is that while wandering the world as an American sailor he is free to take up with girls from any port, but he will eventually settle down and marry a proper, American wife.\nDisturbed by this creed, Sharpless tries to warn Pinkerton against hurting Butterfly. He is even more shocked when she arrives, accompanied by friends and relations, and reveals that, her father being dead, poverty has forced her to become a geisha, and that she is only 15. Butterfly shows Pinkerton the few possessions she is bringing with her, but shrinks from explaining one of them. Goro whispers that it is the dagger her father killed himself with, at the emperor's order. She confesses that she has been to the mission, wishing to adopt her husband's religion.\nThe wedding is performed, but the celebrations are interrupted by the arrival of Butterfly's uncle, the Bonze (Buddhist priest), who denounces her for betraying the gods of her ancestors. Her family flees in horror. Butterfly is comforted by Pinkerton. Night falls and after an impassioned duet, they enter their new home.\nACT II\nThree years later, Butterfly, with almost no money left, is waiting faithfully for Pinkerton's return in the company of her servant Suzuki. Sharpless arrives with a letter from Pinkerton asking him to break the news that he has married his American wife, and although his ship will soon be coming to Nagasaki, he does not intend to see Butterfly again.\nBefore Sharpless can begin she aks him when the robins nest in America. Her husband promised to return when the robins nested, but they have done so three times in Japan since he left, so she thinks that perhaps American robins have different habits.\nAt this Goro, eavesdropping, laughs and Butterfly complains that he is always hanging around, offering her new suitors. Even when one of these, the rich Prince Yamadori, arrives in person, she refuses to take him seriously. Goro explains to Sharpless that it would be better for her if she married again, but she still considers herself properly married to Pinkerton, according to American law. Sharpless tries to break the news about Pinkerton, but she keeps interrupting him with eager comments and questions and, beyond realising that Pinkerton is coming back to Japan, doesn't take in the sense of the letter. Sharpless gives up and asks her what she would do if Pinkerton were never to return and she answers that she would choose to die. He tries to persuade her to marry Yamadori. She becomes angry, then shows him the child she has born to Pinkerton. Sharpless leaves, promising to tell Pinkerton of the child's existence. Suzuki drags in Goro, who has been saying that no one knows who the baby's father is. Butterfly is furious and attacks him with the dagger, but Suzuki calms her and he scuttles off.\nThe gun of the port is heard, denoting the arrival of a ship. Looking through a telescope, Butterfly sees that it is Pinkerton's ship and makes joyful preparations to receive him. She and Suzuki decorate the house throughout with flowers, and, with the baby, prepare to wait through the night till he comes.\nACT III\nNext morning at dawn, only Butterfly is still awake. Pinkerton has not come and she prepares to rest for a while. He arrives with Sharpless, but they warn Suzuki not to rouse Butterfly. Pinkerton is surprised that his arrival was expected and Sharpless reminds him that he had warned him three years ago that Butterfly was taking the ceremony seriously. Suzuki sees a strange woman in the garden. It is Pinkerton's wife, Kate. They tell Suzuki that she must find a way of breaking the news to Butterfly, adding that Kate is willing to take the baby back to America, as the best thing for him.\nPinkerton is overcome with remorse, but Sharpless tells him to leave, as it will be easier to break the news if he is not there. Butterfly runs eagerly out of the bedroom, expecting Pinkerton, but seeing only Kate. She forces the truth from the reluctant Suzuki. Broken-hearted, she realises that a further blow is in store, understanding that she is being asked to part with her child. For his good, she consents, but says that Pinkerton must come himself in half an hour to take him. Sharpless and Kate leave and Butterfly sends the reluctant Suzuki (who understands what she intends) to play with the child.\nAs Butterfly prepares to commit ritual suicide with her father's dagger, Suzuki pushes the child into the room, hoping to distract her, but she bids him a passionate farewell, blindfolds him and stabs herself, dying at Pinkerton's feet when he rushes in the door calling her name."},{"opera_title":"Turandot","composer":"Giacomo Antonio Puccini","synopsis":"ACT I\nNear the walls of Peking\nA mandarin reads a proclamation that the Princess Turandot will marry any man of royal rank who successfully answers three riddles propounded by her, but if he fails he must lose his head.

The crowd is eager for the execution and nearly tramples underfoot the old blind Timur, deposed Tartar king, who is led by the slave girl Li, who cries to the crowd to take pity on him. Calaf, son of Timur, who had been separated from him in exile, recognises his father. Their joy at finding one another still alive is overshadowed by the continued persecution of the king who had defeated them, who is still pursuing Calaf.

To save Timur, Li declares that she alone knows the secret and will not reveal it.\nTurandot appears as the guards begin to torture Li and is unable to understand what gives her the strength to endure. Li answers that it is the power of love, which Turandot will soon feel herself. Seizing a knife from a guard, Li kills herself. Timur and the people, fearing that her offended spirit will seek revenge, pray to her ghost not to harm them, and even Ping, Pang and Pong feel something stirring in their long atrophied hearts.\nThe body of Li is carried out and Calaf and Turandot are left alone.

The priest has already spread the rumor that Nabucco has been killed in battle and is prepared to support Abigaille in her attempt to win the throne.\nScene 2:  A hall in the palace\nZaccaria, entering with a Levite carrying the Tables of the Law, pauses to pray.

The Sacristan bustles about and the painter Mario Cavaradossi continues work on his picture of Mary Magdalene.\nHe has used as his model a fair-haired woman who has been frequenting the church. While admiring her fair beauty, he prefers the dark loveliness of his mistress, the celebrated singer Floria Tosca. When the Sacristan goes outside, Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognised by Cavaradossi as a fellow revolutionary. Tosca is heard calling to Cavaradossi and he advises Angelotti to hide again, giving him a basket of food he has brought for his own meal. Tosca, having heard his voice, is suspicious that he has been entertaining a woman. He soothes her and they look forward to being together in his villa after her concert that night. She is about to leave when she sees the painting. Her jealousy is aroused again, particularly when she recognises the model as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi assures Tosca that he does not know the lady, but has seen her in the church, and she leaves, warning him playfully henceforth to paint only dark-eyed women. Angelotti, emerging from the chapel, reveals that the Marchesa Attavanti is his sister, her presence in the church due to her part in his escape plan, as she has brought women's clothes for him and hidden them in the family chapel. Cavaradossi offers him refuge in his villa outside the city, but before he can leave, a cannon shot signals that the escape has been discovered, and Cavaradossi leaves with him.\nThe Sacristan, full of the news of the defeat of Napoleon, calls the choirboys to prepare to sing a celebratory Te Deum. Their riotous celebration is interrupted by the arrival of Scarpia, the chief of police, with some of his agents. A search verifies his suspicions that Angelotti had taken refuge in the church, one clue being a fan which Angelotti has dropped. Tosca, returning to tell her lover that she will be late that night because she has to sing in a victory cantata, is disconcerted to find him gone. Scarpia, who has had a lustful eye on her for some time and suspects Cavaradossi's part in the escape, plays on her jealousy in the hope that she will lead him to Angelotti. He shows her the fan, claiming that he found it near the painter's easel - a sign of an interrupted assignation.\nRecognising the Attavanti crest, she is only too easily persuaded that Cavaradossi has been unfaithful and sets off for the villa to confront the supposed lovers. Sending his agents after her, Scarpia congratulates himself on the success of his plans, then joins in the Te Deum.\nACT II\nScarpia's apartment in the Villa Farnese\nThat night Scarpia eats his supper as he waits for his agents to bring in Angelotti. He sends a note inviting Tosca to visit him after the victory cantata. He is furious when his agent Spoletta confesses that they had found no trace of Angelotti, but mollified when he learns that they have arrested Cavaradossi because of his suspicious behavior. Cavaradossi defies Scarpia and denies knowing anything about Angelotti, so Scarpia orders his interrogation - using any means necessary. He is unsuccessful in his attempt to trick Tosca into revealing Angelotti's whereabouts, but she is unable to resist Cavaradossi's cries of pain as he is tortured, and gives the information.\nCavaradossi reproaches her bitterly. When news is brought that Napoleon had after all been victorious at Marengo, he exultantly taunts Scarpia, who orders his immediate execution. At first Scarpia turns a deaf ear to Tosca's pleas for mercy, but then reveals that the price for Cavaradossi's life is Tosca herself. In despair, she sees no way out, despite her revulsion, which only makes her more desirable in Scarpia's eyes.\nIn her presence he gives the orders for a fake execution, expressing himself in such a way that it is clear to Spoletta, but not to Tosca, that the execution is in fact to be real. She demands a safe-conduct for herself and Cavaradossi, so that they can leave Rome for ever. As he writes it, she notices a knife on the table, and as Scarpia prepares to embrace her, she stabs him.\nACT III\nCastel Sant'Angelo towards dawn\nA shepherd sings in the distance and church bells ring as preparations are made for the execution. Cavaradossi tries to write a last letter to Tosca, but is overcome by memories of their happiness.\nTosca runs in with the safe-conduct and tells him that she has killed Scarpia.

In fact Mustaf\u00e0 orders her to leave him: he plans to give her to his new Italian slave and instructs Haly, the captain of his pirates, to find him instantly, on pain of impalement, a proud young Italian beauty to tame. Lindoro, the Italian slave captured three months ago, laments his separation from his beloved and is not impressed by the Bey's offer of Elvira, though cautiously refraining from rejecting the idea out of hand.\nScene 2: The seashore\nTo Haly's relief, an Italian ship is wrecked and among the passengers captured by his corsairs is Isabella, who has been searching for her lover Lindoro, accompanied by Taddeo, an elderly admirer.

When Haly announces that she is sure to be the jewel of the Bey's harem, she prepares to use her woman's wiles to get her way.\nTo save him from being taken away by the pirates, she claims Taddeo as her uncle. They quarrel because of his jealousy of Lindoro (whom he has never met), but in view of their tricky situation decide to make peace.\nScene 3: A room in the palace\nZulma, Elvira's confidante, tries to persuade her and Lindoro to agree to the Bey's plan. Mustaf\u00e0 now offers Lindoro his freedom and a passage home to Italy if he will marry Elvira, and Lindoro evades the issue by agreeing to take her with him and think later of marriage. Haly brings the news that an Italian girl, exactly fitting the Bey's specifications, has been captured, and Mustaf\u00e0 prepares to show his prowess at woman taming, peremptorily ordering Elvira to go. Despite his harsh treatment, she still loves him.\nScene 4: A magnificent hall\nIsabella is brought before the Bey and, instantly summing him up as a booby, pretends to be smitten.

He relents when Isabella again claims Taddeo as her uncle. Elvira, Zulma and Lindoro come to make their farewells, and Lindoro and Isabella are thunderstruck to see one another. Mustaf\u00a6 is puzzled at their reaction, but then thunderstruck on his own account when Isabella, learning of his plan for Elvira, insists that he must not send his wife away.

The action extends over one day, the final scene taking place shortly after sunrise. In the original source Rodelinda and Cunicpert are sent into exile; in the opera she remains in Milan and becomes the central figure. The actions around her must therefore all be regarded as fictitious.\n\tPrologue\n\tGrimoaldo has defeated Bertarido in battle and usurped his throne. Bertarido has fled, and it is believed that he has died in exile, but he sends word to his friend Unulfo that he is alive and in hiding near the palace. Grimoaldo is betrothed to Bertarido's sister Eduige, and though she loves him and he returns her affection, at least at first, she keeps putting off the wedding. Rodelinda and her son, Flavio, are being kept in the palace by Grimoaldo, who has fallen in love with her.\n\tAct 1\n\tAlone, Rodelinda mourns the loss of her husband. Grimoaldo enters and proposes marriage to her; he offers her the throne back, and confesses his love for her. She angrily rejects him. Eduige tells Grimoaldo that he has become treacherous now that he is king; he answers that he is treacherous for the sake of justice, referring to the fact that she so often refused to marry him and now he, at Garibaldo's instigation, is rejecting her. With Grimoaldo gone, the scheming Garibaldo, who has previously professed to love Eduige, offers to bring her Grimoaldo's head. She declines, but swears that she will be revenged eventually. Alone, Garibaldo details his plan to use Eduige to help him take the throne for himself.\n\tMeanwhile, Bertarido reads the inscription on his own memorial. Along with Unulfo, he watches from hiding as Rodelinda and Flavio lay flowers at the memorial. Garibaldo enters and offers Rodelinda an ultimatum; either she agrees to marry Grimoaldo or Flavio will be killed. Rodelinda agrees, but warns Garibaldo that she will use his head as a step to the throne. Bertarido, still watching, takes Rodelinda's decision as an act of infidelity. Grimoaldo tells Garibaldo not to worry about Rodelinda's threat; under the king's protection, what does he have to fear? Unulfo, meanwhile, tries to comfort Bertarido, but Bertarido is unconvinced.\n\tAct 2\n\tGaribaldo, as part of his plan to take the throne, tells Eduige that it appears she has lost her chance to become queen, and encourages her to take revenge on Grimoaldo. Eduige then turns her bitterness on Rodelinda, pointing out Rodelinda's sudden decision to betray her husband's memory and marry his usurper. Rodelinda reminds Eduige of who's queen. Eduige again vows vengeance on Grimoaldo, though it is clear she still loves him. Eduige departs and Grimoaldo enters, asking Rodelinda if it is true that she's agreed to marry him. She assures him that it is true, but that she has one condition: Grimoaldo must first kill Flavio in front of her. Grimoaldo, horrified, refuses. Once Rodelinda departs, Garibaldo encourages Grimoaldo to carry out the murder and take Rodelinda as his wife, but Grimoaldo again refuses. He says that Rodelinda's act of courage and determination has made him love her all the more, though he has lost all hope of ever winning her over. Unulfo asks Garibaldo how he could give a king such appalling advice, and Garibaldo expounds his Macchiavellian perspective on the use of power. Bertarido, meanwhile, has approached the palace grounds in disguise, where Eduige recognizes him. She agrees to tell Rodelinda that her husband is still alive. Rodelinda and Bertarido meet in secret, but are discovered by an outraged Grimoaldo. He doesn't recognize Bertarido, but vows to kill him anyway, whether he be Rodelinda's real husband or just her lover. The spouses, before being separated again, bid each other a last farewell.\n\tAct 3\n\tUnulfo and Eduige make a plan to release Bertarido from prison; they'll smuggle him a weapon and the key to the secret passage that runs under the palace. Grimoaldo, meanwhile, is having a crisis of conscience over the impending execution. Bertarido, in his cell, receives his package. Unulfo, who is allowed access to the prison in an official capacity, comes to release Bertarido. Bertarido, however, can't recognize Unulfo in the darkness, and mistakenly wounds him with the sword. Unulfo shrugs the injury off, and the two leave. Eduige and Rodelinda, meanwhile, have come to visit Bertarido. Finding the cell empty and blood on the floor, they despair of his life. Grimoaldo is still struggling with conscience and flees to the palace garden, hoping to find a peaceful spot where he can finally fall asleep; even shepherds, he laments, can find rest under trees and bushes, but he, a king, can find no rest anywhere. He finally falls asleep, but Garibaldo finds him and decides to take advantage of the situation. He is about to kill Grimoaldo with his own sword when Bertarido enters and kills Garibaldo. Grimoaldo, however, he spares. Grimoaldo gladly gives up all claim to the throne and turns to Eduige, telling her that they shall wed and rule together in his own duchy.

Leonora, on the point of eloping with Don Alvaro, the stranger, is seized with remorse, thinking mournfully of her life when parted forever from her country and her family, while her maid Curra tries to encourage her to pack, warning her of the fate which attends Alvaro if she were to yield to the temptation of confessing to her father.\n\tWhen Alvaro arrives, she is still reluctant to leave, asking him to delay by one day, so she can see her father again; but when Alvaro accuses her of not loving him, she responds to his passion and prepares to elope. But they are surprised by the Marquis and servants. Swearing that Leonora is pure, Alvaro offers his breast to the Marquis, who disdains to kill one he considers beneath him. Alvaro throws his pistol to the floor and it goes off, killing the Marquis, who dies cursing his daughter. Leonora and Alvaro flee.\n\tACT II\n\tScene 1. The inn of the village of Hornachuelos\n\tArriving at the inn disguised as a man, Leonora hides when she sees her brother, Don Carlo, among the crowd waiting for supper. Don Carlo, disguised as a student, begins to interrogate the muleteer Trabuco about the identity of the person he brought to the inn (Leonora), but is interrupted by the arrival of the gipsy Preziosilla on her way to join the Spanish army fighting in Italy. After a rousing call to arms, she offers to tell fortunes, and sees misfortune in Carlo's hand, and also makes it clear that she knows he is not what he says he is.\n\tA procession of pilgrims passes on its way to the monastery of Hornachuelos and the company joins in the prayer. Carlo continues to question Trabuco about the sex of the traveller, and even suggests painting a moustache on his face as he sleeps, until restrained by the mayor, who asks him to account for himself. His name is Pereda, he answers, a student from Salamanca, who had accompanied his friend Don Carlo di Vargas in search of his sister and her foreign lover who had killed their father; Carlo has gone to (South) America and he will return to his studies. All go to bed.\n\tScene 2. Outside the monastery of Hornachuelos in the mountains\n\tLeonora reaches her goal, the monastery, terrified to have recognised her brother and heard him tell her story. She also heard him say that Don Alvaro, whom she had thought killed in the confusion on the night of the failed elopement, is alive and has gone to South America; and believes that he has deserted her. She rings the bell and manages to convince the reluctant porter, brother Melitone, of her urgent need to see the Padre Guardiano.\n\tTo the Padre Guardiano she reveals her identity. She had been sent to him by her confessor, as she wishes to follow the example of another woman and live as a hermit in a cave not far from the monastery. After some reluctance, he consents and calls the monks to prayer, to give her his blessing and state to her and the brothers (who do not know she is a woman) the conditions of her future life: she is to see no one and remain undisturbed; he will leave food for her and only in extreme danger or at the hour of her death is she to ring a bell to summon him.\n\tACT III\n\tScene 1. In Italy, near Velletri during the War of the Austrian Succession\n\tAs soldiers carouse in the background, Don Alvaro reveals in a soliloquy that he is the son of a Spaniard who had married the daughter of the last of the Incas and tried to free Peru from Spanish rule. His parents had been defeated, put in prison, where Alvaro was born, and executed, while he was brought up in the wilderness. Unaware that Leonora is still alive, he prays to her to look down on him from heaven.\n\tDisturbed by sounds of quarrelling and a cry for help, he rescues Don Carlo from the consequences of a quarrel over a game of cards. Excusing himself for being in such low company, on the grounds that he is but recently arrived, Carlo identifies himself as Don Felice de Bornos, aide-de-camp to the general, and Alvaro gives in reply the name he has assumed, Don Federico, Herreros, captain of grenadiers and, as Carlo exclaims in delight, the pride of the army. The two swear eternal friendship and go into battle together.\n\tAlvaro is wounded and Carlo exhorts the surgeon to save him, promising Alvaro the order of Calatrava for his bravery. Feeling death near, Alvaro begs Carlo to burn unopened a packet of documents he will find among his possessions, and Carlo swears to obey; but while the surgeon is operating, doubts occur, spurred by Alvaro's horrified reaction to the name of Calatrava. He is tempted to open the packet, but his sense of honor restrains him. But near the packet he finds a portrait of Leonora and his suspicions are confirmed, and he receives with joy the news that Alvaro will live - so that he can kill him.\n\tScene 2. The camp near Velletri\n\tThe sun rises on bustling camp activity. Among those present is Preziosilla, telling fortunes, Trabuco, trafficking with the soldiers, and Melitone, reproving everyone for pagan goings-on on Sunday. When the soldiers turn on him, Preziosilla averts their wrath by embarking on a rousing rataplan.\n\tACT IV\n\tScene 1. The courtyard of the monastery of Hornachuelos five years later\n\tBrother Melitone is dispensing food to the poor, complaining as he does so, so that they compare him unfavourably with the charitable Father Raffaele. When they have gone he discusses Father Raffaele with the Father Superior, explaining that he seems more like the devil than a member of a monastic order.\n\tDon Carlo knocks at the gate asking for Father Raffaele (Alvaro) and when they are alone confronts him, wishing to resume the interrupted duel - he has even brought two swords. But Alvaro has withdrawn from the world and tries to avoid the conflict. Rising to Carlo's taunt on his ancestry, he gains control of himself, but a blow cannot be overlooked and they run off to fight to the death.\n\tScene 2. A mountain gorge near a cave in the vicinity of the monastery\n\tLeonora, dressed as a hermit, appears from the cave, praying for peace of mind: she has been unable to forget Don Alvaro.\n\tThe sound of fighting disturbs her and she calls an imprecation on the heads of those disturbing her holy refuge. But the voice of the dying Carlo is heard calling for confession and Alvaro comes to beg the hermit to give him the last rites. They recognise one another and Alvaro tells her her brother lies dying. She goes to him, but he stabs her as he dies.\n\tAs she reappears, supported by the Padre Guardiano, Alvaro curses his fate and heaven, but is reproved by the Padre Guardiano, and Leonora assures him that heaven will pardon him.

He then warns Otello to beware of jealousy and advises him to observe his wife.

(Song: \"Hier im ird'schen Jammerthal\".)\nHe hands Max his gun loaded with a magic bullet, and to his own astonishment Max kills an eagle soaring at a great height. He resolves to go with Kaspar at midnight to the terrible Wolf\u2019s Glen to cast the magic bullets, which will kill anything the shooter wants, in order to win the prize. Kaspar, left alone, triumphs. (Aria: \"Schweig! damit dich Niemand warrant\").\nACT II\nScene 1: Agathe\u2019s chamber\nAgathe is filled with sad forebodings. She sings of her meeting with a hermit in the forest, who told her that in some danger which menaced her, she would be protected by her bridal wreath. At the moment when Max shoots the magic bullet, the picture of Agathe\u2019s ancestor hanging against the wall falls to the floor, slightly wounding her. Agathe's cousin and companion \u00c4nnchen replaces it. (Duet: \"Schelm, halt fest!\"). Agathe is still more disturbed, but \u00c4nnchen endeavours to cheer her with jests. (Arietta: \"Kommt ein schlanker Bursch gegangen\").\nAgathe left alone awaits Max with the news of his success, which she decides to interpret as a favourable omen. (Recitative and aria: \"Wie nahte mir der Schlummer \u2026 Leise, leise).\nMax arrives; he acknowledges that he has not been the victor, but explains that he has killed a deer, which he will bring this evening from the Wolf\u2019s Glen. Notwithstanding the prayers of Agathe and \u00c4nnchen, Max departs. (Trio: \"Wie? Was? Entsetzen!\").\nScene 2: The Wolf\u2019s Glen at night\nKaspar calls upon Zamiel, the black ranger, for assistance, and prepares the casting of the magic bullets. Max arrives and is warned by the spirit of his mother to abandon the project. Zamiel conjures up the shape of Agathe, representing her as drowning herself in despair at Max\u2019s ill success, whereupon he plunges into the glen and with demoniacal noise the casting of the bullets is begun.\nACT III\nScene 1: Agathe\u2019s chamber\nAgathe is praying. (Aria: \"Und ob die Wolke sie verh\u00fclle\"). Her doubts have returned, owing to a dream of ill omen, but \u00c4nnchen again cheers her with laughter and song. (Romance and aria, subsequently added by Weber: \" Einst tr\u00e4umte meiner sel'gen Base\"). The bridesmaids arrive with the bridal wreath. (Song: \"Wir winden dir den Jungfern-Kranz\"). When \u00c4nnchen opens the box, however, she finds within a funeral wreath, which still further increases Agathe\u2019s misgivings. She is somewhat comforted by the memory of the hermit\u2019s promise that she shall be protected by her bridal wreath.\nScene 2: The meeting of the marksmen\nHaving split the seven bullets between them, Max has used four and Kaspar has used three. Max demands Kaspar give him his last bullet to use in the final shooting contest, but Kaspar refuses. As Max leaves, Kaspar shoots a fox, thus making Max's bullet the seventh and controlled by the Evil One.\nScene 3: The prize shooting\nDuke Ottokar awaits Max at his tent. (Chorus of foresters: \"Was gleicht wohl auf Erden\"). Max is now to shoot a dove. As he takes aim, Zamiel, the black huntsman, appears to guide the bullet, and causes Max to fire at Agathe, who is apparently wounded. (Finale: \"Schaut, o schaut\"). Agathe falls, but her bridal wreath has deflected the bullet, which struck Kaspar. Agathe revives from her faint. Kaspar, seeing a holy hermit by her side, realizes that he has failed. Zamiel grasps him instead of Max, whereupon Kaspar expires with a curse upon his lips. Duke Ottokar orders the corpse to be thrown into the Wolf\u2019s Glen, then demands and receives an explanation from Max. In spite of pleas from Kuno, Agathe, peasants, and huntsman, the infuriated duke pronounces the sentence of banishment. Before this can be carried out, however, the hermit enters into their midst. The duke acknowledges the holy man, and asks for his counsel. The hermit explains that the combined effects of love for Agathe, and fear of losing her should he fail the shooting trial are what caused Max to stray from a life that was formerly without fault. The hermit goes on to condemn the trial shot, suggests a probationary year as penalty, and asks who among the assembled has looked into their own heart and would be willing to cast the first stone. If Max lives a faultless life, he will gain forgiveness and be permitted to marry Agathe. The Duke commends the hermit for his wisdom saying a higher power speaks through him. The duke ends his pronouncement by saying he, himself, will place the hand of Agathe in that of Max when the probation is over. The opera ends with the ensemble singing prayers of thanks."},{"opera_title":"Die Fledermaus","composer":"Johann Strauss jr","synopsis":"ACT I\nEisenstein's house\n\tAlfred is outside, serenading Rosalinde. Adele has been invited to a ball by her sister Ida, a singer, but when she asks her mistress for the night off to visit a sick aunt, Rosalinde, who has heard the excuse before, is unsympathetic, particularly as her husband has to go to jail that night for insulting a policeman. After serenading Rosalinde outside the window, Alfred comes in to press his suit, but Rosalinde reminds him that she is married, though she is touched by his reminder that they had been in love when students at the conservatorium. Learning that Eisenstein will be in jail for five nights, he promises to return later.\n\tEisenstein comes home with his lawyer, Dr Blind, whose inefficiency has increased his sentence. He asks Rosalinde to dig out some old clothes, so he will not look out of place in jail.\n\tDr Falke arrives, ostensibly to commiserate with Eisenstein, but actually to invite him (unknown to Rosalinde) to a grand ball that night to be given by the young and wealthy Prince Orlofsky, convincing him that he will be able to go incognito and then report to the jail first thing in the morning.\n\tRosalinde tells Adele that she may have the evening off and Eisenstein goes off to change his clothes - into full evening dress. Rosalinde, Adele and Eisenstein all rejoice in the prospect of the evening's planned diversions. When the others have gone, Rosalinde receives an invitation to the ball with a new dress and a mask. Alfred returns and makes himself at home with Eisenstein's cap and dressing gown and supper. Colonel Frank arrives to escort his distinguished prisoner to jail in person. He assumes that Alfred is Eisenstein and Rosalinde begs him to go along with this to preserve her reputation. Alfred is led off after taking advantage of the situation to seize a long farewell kiss.\nACT II\nPrince Orlofsky's ballroom\n\tAdele discovers that her sister had not sent the invitation, but they decide to make the best of the situation: Adele is to call herself Olga and pretend to be an actress.\n\tFalke promises to entertain Prince Orlofsky, who finds everything a great bore, with a diversion called the Revenge of the Bat. He is seeking revenge on Eisenstein for having left him by a fountain, drunk and in the costume of a bat. When he woke up in the morning he had to make his way home in fancy dress to the amusement of the bystanders. He explains that Adele, the first character in his scenario, is his hero's maid, while Eisenstein, who is announced as the Marquis de Renard, is the central figure.\n\tThe prince tells Eisenstein that the only rule of his house is that everyone should do as he pleases; he has been promised a good laugh, at Eisenstein's expense. Catching sight of Adele, Eisenstein is astonished by her resemblance to his wife's chambermaid, but she laughs at him for his \"mistake.\"\n\tThe Chevalier Chagrin arrives, Colonel Frank under an assumed name and another of Falke's cast, followed by Rosalinde, masked and calling herself a Hungarian countess, the last of his cast. Eisenstein tries to persuade Rosalinde to unmask, and he tries out his chiming watch, which usually entrances the ladies, but she manages to get it from him. To add conviction to her impersonation, the supposed Hungarian countess sings a czardas. The guests sing a toast to champagne. Eisenstein hurries off to jail, followed by Frank.\nACT III\nThe jail\n\tFrosch the jailer lurches drunkenly about his business as Alfred bursts into occasional song. When Frank appears, also intoxicated, Frosch tells him that the supposed Eisenstein is demanding his lawyer. Adele and Ida appear, to take up the offer made by Frank to help the supposed Olga's career as an actress. She confesses that she is really a chambermaid, but gives a demonstration of her acting and singing skills. When Eisenstein reports for his sentence, he and Frank are surprised to recognise one another as guests at the ball, but Frank believes he already has Eisenstein in jail. When Dr Blind arrives, Eisenstein borrows his wig and gown. Rosalinde arrives and Alfred is brought from his cell and they try to explain to the supposed lawyer how the mix-up occurred, assuring him that it was quite innocent. Flinging off the wig, Eisenstein launches into a denunciation, which is cut short when Rosalinde produces his watch, as evidence of his philandering. He then tries to pretend that he is not Eisenstein, but Adele identifies him.\n\tAccompanied by Orlofsky and his guests, Falke arrives to explain the plot to Eisenstein. All join in another chorus to champagne."},{"opera_title":"Andrea Chenier","composer":"Umberto Giordano","synopsis":"ACT I\nThe country estate of the Coigny family, the winter-garden of the chateau, 1789\nA major-domo is supervising the preparations for a party. Carlo G\u00e9rard, one of the lackeys, breaks into a harangue against the aristocrats, an invective made more bitter by the sight of his old father, a gardener, struggling with a heavy weight. He hates the house and all in it - except, as he reveals when she appears with her mother, Maddalena, the daughter of the house, whose beauty charms even his embittered soul. Maddalena is still not dressed, but, as she tells Bersi, her mulatto maid, she hates the restrictive fashions and hairstyles of the day and intends to wear a simple white dress and a rose in her hair.\nThe guests arrive and the novelist Fl\u00e9ville introduces the young poet Ch\u00e9nier. Discussion of affairs in Paris indicates that the country is in turmoil, but the guests determine to enjoy the evening. When Ch\u00e9nier evades an invitation from the countess to recite some of his poetry, Maddalena makes a bet with her friends that she can make him say something poetic; but he declines her invitation also, saying that the muse of poetry is shy like love.\nMaddalena laughs, because he fell into her trap and used the word \"love\"; and Ch\u00e9nier, stung, promises to make clear to her the real meaning of love, and recites a poem (the Improvviso) in which he describes the poverty of the people and the indifference of the aristocracy to their sufferings, ending with an attack on Maddalena, telling her that she too, young and beautiful as she is, does not know the real meaning of love. She is abashed, the guests are indignant, and only G\u00e9rard, listening in the distance, is moved.\nA dance is about to begin, but a crowd of wretched people approaches the chateau and G\u00e9rard admits them, declaring his solidarity with them and tearing off his livery and compelling his father to leave with him. The peasants leave and there is an attempt to resume the festivities.\nACT II\nParis, June 1794\nMingling with the crowd and disguised in the extravagant costume of a merveilleuse, Bersi suspects that she is being watched by a spy dressed in the equally fantastic garb of an incroyable. She accosts him and explains defensively that she is, like him, a true child of the revolution. The spy suspects a connection between the beautiful blonde he has seen with her and Ch\u00e9nier, whom he has been watching.\nCh\u00e9nier's friend Roucher brings him a passport, but Ch\u00e9nier, although in danger, refuses to leave. He believes that he is on the threshold of an adventure, as he has been receiving mysterious letters from a woman who signs herself Hope. But Roucher, basing his opinion on the scented notepaper, convinces him that it can only be a woman of the street and he agrees to take the passport and escape.\nAcclaimed by the crowd, Robespierre and other Representatives appear, among them G\u00e9rard, who is called aside by the spy who tells him that he has found the woman G\u00e9rard is searching for. Despite being beset by the spy, Bersi manages to tell Ch\u00e9nier that a woman who is in great danger, whose name is Hope, wants to speak to him and he agrees, despite Roucher's warning that it is a trap.\nWatched by the spy, Maddalena, disguised as a servant, arrives. As Ch\u00e9nier recognises her, the spy goes off to tell G\u00e9rard. Maddalena explains that she had hesitated to approach Ch\u00e9nier when he was powerful and she was in danger, but had often written to him, as to a brother; but now she feels she is in danger and asks for his help.\nRealising that she is to be the love of his life, Ch\u00e9nier agrees to help her. They declare their mutual love and their intention of staying together, but G\u00e9rard, warned by the spy, appears and tries to claim Maddalena. She escapes with Roucher, who has been keeping guard, while Ch\u00e9nier and G\u00e9rard fight. G\u00e9rard is wounded, but recognising his opponent he warns him to escape and protect Maddalena; and when the crowd rushes to his aid, tells them that he did not know his assailant.\nACT III\nThe Revolutionary Tribunal\nWaiting for a trial to begin, the sansculotte Mathieu calls on the crowd to make donations to save their country from foreigners, abusing them when they do not respond; but when G\u00e9rard, recovered from his wound, appeals to them, they offer their jewellery for the cause. An old blind woman, Madelon, brings her young grandson, whose father was recently killed in battle, and offers him to the Republic.\nThe spy reports to G\u00e9rard that Ch\u00e9nier has been arrested, but Maddalena has disappeared; but he is convinced that the news of his arrest will bring her out of hiding. G\u00e9rard prepares the indictment against Ch\u00e9nier, torn between his belief that Ch\u00e9nier is no traitor (although he is on the public prosecutor's list) and his passion for Maddalena, reflecting on how this passion has adulterated the purity of his revolutionary fervor and his concern for the downtrodden.\nMaddalena comes to plead for Ch\u00e9nier and G\u00e9rard admits to having had her followed and that, far from hating her as she thinks, he has loved her since childhood. Maddalena understands him and offers herself in exchange for Ch\u00e9nier's life, telling him of how her mother had died saving her from the mob, how Bersi had sold herself to provide for her and how love had come to her in her wretchedness.\nThe list of those to be tried is brought to G\u00e9rard, and Ch\u00e9nier's name is on it; but G\u00e9rard, moved by Maddalena's appeal, promises to try and save him.\nThe trial begins and after some hasty condemnations, it is Ch\u00e9nier's turn. He defends himself against the accusation, saying that as a soldier he had confronted death proudly and as a poet has used his pen against hypocrisy.\nG\u00e9rard interrputs the proceedings to claim that the indictment he wrote is a lie, and that Ch\u00e9nier is a true son of the revolution, but he is disregarded and the death sentence is pronounced.\nACT IV\nThe prison of St Lazare\nRoucher is taking leave of Ch\u00e9nier, who reads him his last poem, which he has just written and in which he compares his last moments to the end of a lovely May day.\nG\u00e9rard brings Maddalena, who bribes the jailer to let her take the place of a young woman, Idia Legray, who had been condemned that day. G\u00e9rard rushes away to try and see Robespierre and save her life and Ch\u00e9nier's.

Unimpressed by her attempts at charm, they try to run away, but she casts a spell on them, rendering them immobile.\nShe puts Hansel in a cage and forces Gretel to run errands. She orders Hansel to put his finger through the bars, and, being short-sighted, is deceived when he substitutes a bone and decides that she must fatten him up.\nWhen her back is turned, Gretel picks up her wand and frees Hansel from the spell. The Witch tells her to see if the oven is hot enough, but Hansel, creeping out of the cage, warns her to take care, so she pretends not to understand what she has to do. Impatiently the Witch demonstrates, and the children shove her into the oven and close the door. They dance with glee and the oven explodes. They realise that the gingerbread children have come to life, although they are unable to see. Thanking Hansel and Gretel for freeing them, the children explain that if they touch them they will be able to see, and they do so. Gertrude and Peter arrive in time to join in the rejoicings and thank God for the deliverance of their children."},{"opera_title":"Simon Boccanegra","composer":"Giuseppe Verdi","synopsis":"Time: The middle of the 14th century.Place: In and around Genoa.\n Prologue\nPaolo, the leader of the Plebian party, persuades Pietro to support the nomination of Simon Boccanegra for doge of Genoa. Boccanegra arrives and agrees to stand, thinking that Fiesco would then allow him to wed his daughter, Maria, who is being held prisoner in her father's gloomy palace because she bore Boccanegra an illegitimate child. Pietro rallies support for Boccanegra. Fiesco enters, stricken with grief over his daughter's death (Il lacerato spirito - \"The tortured soul of a sad father\"), but he does not reveal this to Boccanegra who accosts Fiesco and begs his forgiveness. Fiesco promises clemency only if Boccanegra lets Fiesco have his granddaughter. Boccanegra explains he cannot because the child has vanished. As the people hail Simon as the new Doge, he finds the body of his beloved.\n Act 1\nScene 1: Twenty-five years later\nThe Doge has exiled many of his political opponents and confiscated their property. In the Grimaldi castle, Fiesco, to avoid discovery, is using the name Andrea Grimaldi, plotting with Boccanegra's enemies to overthrow him.

They called her Amelia, hoping that she would be the heir to their family's fortune, their sons having been exiled. Amelia awaits her lover, Gabriele Adorno (Aria:Come in quest'ora bruna - \"How in the morning light \/ The sea and stars shine brightly\"). He arrives, and she warns him of the dangers of political conspiracy. Word arrives that the Doge is coming.

When Adorno says that he does not care, Fiesco blesses the marriage. Boccanegra enters. He pardons Amelia's exiled brothers, but she refuses to marry Paolo. When she tells Boccanegra that she was adopted, the two compare pictures in their lockets and realizes that she is his long-lost daughter. Finally reunited, they are overcome with joy. When Paolo enters, Boccanegra denies permission for the arranged marriage.

Boccanegra has Adorno arrested for the night (Aria: Plebe! Patrizi! Popolo! - \"Plebians! Patricians! Inheritors \/ Of a fierce history\"). Discerning that Paolo is the actual man responsible, he makes everyone, including Paolo, utter a curse on the real kidnapper.\n Act 2\nPaolo and Fiesco discuss plans to murder Boccanegra, but Fiesco refuses. Paolo next tells Adorno that Amelia is the Doge's mistress, hoping Adorno will murder Boccanegra. Just before Amelia enters, Adorno's anger and jealousy prompts an angry outburst (Aria: Sento avvampar nell'anima - \"I feel a furious jealousy \/ Setting my soul on fire\").

It is only the intervention of a young sea captain that keeps the angry mob at bay.\nCalm is restored at the approach of Alvise Badoero, a member of the Venetian Inquisition, and his wife, Laura. Laura places La Cieca under her personal protection, and in gratitude the old woman presents her with her most treasured possession, a rosary.

Recalling that Laura was engaged to the now banished nobleman Enzo Grimaldi before her forced marriage to Alvise, Barnaba realises that the sea captain is Enzo in disguise.\nBarnaba confronts Enzo, who admits his purpose in returning to Venice is to take Laura and begin a new life elsewhere. Barnaba knows that Gioconda is also infatuated with Enzo and he sees an opportunity to improve his chances with her by assisting Enzo with his plan of elopement.\nWhen Enzo has gone Barnaba dictates a letter to Alvise revealing his wife's infidelity and the lovers' plan of escape.

He has dreamed of the world outside: the sun, the seasons, the birds, which he misses.\nVenus reproaches him for not appreciating the delights she offers. She orders him to take his harp and celebrate the joys of love. He obeys, but three times begins in praise of Venus and three times ends on a different theme - his longing for the real world, rather than a life of continuous bliss, for nature and for freedom, even if it brings pain and death - and begs to be allowed to leave. Finding anger, blandishments and entreaties equally unavailing, Venus orders him to go, but warns that his search will be in vain and that he will soon long to return to her realm; all mankind will be cursed if he does not come back. But he is firm in his determination never to return - he will repent and be saved by the Virgin. At this name, the Venusberg vanishes.\nScene 2: A valley near the Wartburg in Thuringia\nTannh\u00e4user finds himself in the valley. A shepherd boy sings a song in praise of Holda, goddess of spring, and a band of pilgrims passes by singing, on the road to Rome. Tannh\u00e4user falls to his knees in prayer, where he is found by the Landgrave of Thuringia and his band of minstrels, Tannh\u00e4user's former companions.\nWith the exception of Wolfram, who greets him warmly, they treat him with reservation, expecting renewal of the strife and pride in which he had left them. He assures him that he has no belligerent intentions and does not plan to remain. They then beg him to stay, but he refuses until Wolfram mentions Elisabeth, niece of the Landgrave. Wolfram tells him that since his departure, Elisabeth, who had previously listened joyfully to their song contests, has withdrawn in sadness and Tannhuser is persuaded to return to the court.\nACT II\nThe hall of the minstrels in the Wartburg\nElisabeth, rejoicing in Tannh\u00e4user's return, joyfully greets the hall of song from which she and he have been so long absent. Wolfram leads in Tannh\u00e4user who falls at her feet. He tells her that he has been far away in strange lands, only able to return to her by a miracle. She wonders why his songs had such power over her that she was so delighted by them and so desolate at his absence, and he replies that the god of love must have touched his strings and then brought him back to her. Seeing their joy at being reunited, Wolfram realises that all hope of Elisabeth is over for him.\nThe Landgrave is glad to see Elisabeth back in the hall, and asks her to confide in him. She is unable to speak out, but, suspecting her love for Tannh\u00e4user, he hints that the forthcoming song contest will fulfil her wishes.\nThe court and the minstrels enter and the Landgrave, looking back on former times of peace and war, when the minstrels' songs had gladdened their hearts, offers the theme of love for the song contest and, believing that Tannh\u00e4user will be the victor, promises that Elisabeth will crown the winner - with his heart's desire. Wolfram opens with a song in praise of the cool refreshing stream of love at which the lover must not drink, but only worship. All praise the song, except Tannh\u00e4user, who breaks in with the view that one must drink at the spring, which is eternal and inexhaustible. Elisabeth seems to approve, but the rest of the company shows its disapproval by silence.\nWalther takes up the same line as Wolfram - the spring will be defiled if the lover drinks. The company applauds, but Tannh\u00e4user again objects that love is not distant reverence, but something to be held close. Disapproval is expressed more strongly this time and Biterolf angrily declares his readiness to defend women's honor against him with the sword. Tannh\u00e4user answers that Biterolf knows nothing of the soft emotion of love.\nThe Landgrave intervenes to stop the strife and Wolfram again proclaims his lofty conception of love, provoking Tannh\u00e4user to sing that only one who has dwelt in the arms of Venus knows true love. At his revelation that he has been in the Venusberg, all the ladies except Elisabeth run out of the hall. The angry knights draw their swords on Tannh\u00e4user, who stands as if dazed. Elisabeth runs between them, declaring that although he has wounded her to the heart, he must be spared and allowed to repent. They become calm and Tannh\u00e4user, grieved at what he has done to Elisabeth and at his sin with Venus, accepts the Landgrave's command to join the pilgrimage to Rome.\nACT III\nThe valley of the Wartburg\nWolfram comes upon Elisabeth praying at a shrine. She is waiting for the return of the pilgrims and he hopes that she will not be disappointed. Pilgrims return, rejoicing at having received absolution from the Pope, but Tannh\u00e4user is not among them and Elisabeth, begging the forgiveness of the Virgin for having once turned from heavenly things to an earthly love, prays for death so that in heaven she may be able to pray for Tannh\u00e4user's soul. Wolfram begs to be allowed to accompany her, but she indicates that she must travel alone, and climbs up the mountain to the Wartburg as Wolfram prays to the evening star to watch over her.\nTannh\u00e4user returns seeking the way to the Venusberg. He tells Wolfram that although he mortified himself with hard penances on the way to Rome, the Pope had refused him absolution, declaring that one who had sinned as he had could no more be forgiven than his staff could bear leaves. In despair, Tannh\u00e4user calls on Venus, who appears in answer to his summons. Wolfram's entreaties are in vain, till he reminds Tannh\u00e4user of Elisabeth. Tannh\u00e4user comes to his senses, crying Elisabeth's name, and Venus vanishes. He kneels as Elisabeth's body is carried by, begging her to pray for his soul, and dies as more pilgrims return with the news that the Pope's staff has borne leaves."},{"opera_title":"Les Contes d'Hoffmann","composer":"Jacques Offenbach","synopsis":"PROLOGUE\nLuther's tavern\nHoffmann's muse hopes that he will forget his love for the singer Stella and devote himself henceforth to poetry.\nCouncillor Lindorf intercepts a letter from Stella to Hoffmann, promising him an assignation after the evening's performance of Don Giovanni, in which she is appearing, and enclosing her key. Taking possession of the letter and key, Lindorf announces that it will be he, not Hoffmann, who uses it later. He says he will also take Hoffmann's place in the lady's affections: he may be old and unattractive, but he is still vigorous and he can compel through fear.\nThe first act of Don Giovanni ends and students pour into the tavern, followed shortly by Hoffmann and his friend Nicklausse. Hoffmann is out of sorts and offers to cheer himself up and entertain the company by singing a song about the dwarf Kleinzach. In the midst of his account of the dwarf's physical peculiarities, however, he breaks off into a rhapsody about Stella's charms. His friends bring him back to earth and he finishes the song.\nHe notices Lindorf and accuses him of being his evil genius. Lindorf taunts him with being in love, and his friends avert a quarrel by praising their mistresses. Expressing his contempt for these ladies, Hoffmann promises to tell the stories of his own three loves.\nACT I\nThe reception room in the house of the inventor Spalanzani\nSpalanzani and his servant Cochenille are preparing for a ball to present Spalanzani's \"daughter\" Olympia to the world. Hoffmann, Spalanzani's pupil, arrives early and the inventor withdraws to leave Hoffmann alone with Olympia, who is sitting motionless behind a curtain. Finding him in rapt admiration of Olympia, Nicklausse hints broadly that he is in love with a doll, but Hoffmann refuses to listen. Copp\u00e9lius, in search of Spalanzani, finds Hoffmann and sells him a pair of rosy spectacles through which Olympia appears more beautiful (and lifelike) than ever. He then confronts Spalanzani with a demand for payment for the eyes he made for Olympia and, to get rid of him, Spalanzani gives him a cheque on the firm of Elias, of whose bankruptcy he has just learnt. Olympia sings a brilliant song to entertain the guests, who go to supper, except for Hoffmann, who declares his love to Olympia, accidentally pressing a switch which causes her to run away.\nCopp\u00e9lius returns, furious at having been cheated, and hides in Olympia's bower. The guests reappear, the waltz begins and Hoffmann dances with Olympia, who whirls faster and faster until he falls and breaks his glasses. Cochenille manages to shepherd Olympia into her room, but sounds of smashing precede the appearance of Copp\u00e9lius waving the broken pieces of the doll. All laugh at the deluded Hoffmann, who now realises that his love was an automaton.\nACT II\nCrespel's house\nAs she sings to her own accompaniment on the piano, Antonia remembers happier days with Hoffmann, from whom her father has separated her, fearing that he may encourage her desire to sing. He begs her not to sing any more, and she obeys sadly. Unknown to Antonia, her father fears her resemblance to her mother, a famous singer who had died of a chest complaint exacerbated by singing. He goes out, telling his deaf servant to admit no one.\nFrantz takes the opportunity to try his hand, unsuccessfully, at singing and dancing. His incomprehension of his master's orders causes him to admit Hoffmann and Nicklausse, and Hoffmann and Antonia have an ecstatic reunion. When she sings for him, he notes the signs of fever, and she tells him that her father has forbidden her to sing. Crespel returns, and Hoffmann hides and observes the visit of Dr Miracle: once more Frantz's deafness has prevented Crespel from keeping out an unwelcome visitor.\nBelieving that Dr Miracle killed his wife, and fearing his influence on Antonia, Crespel refuses to let him examine her, but Dr Miracle proceeds to examine her in absentia and when he orders her to sing, her voice can be heard from her room. Crespel rejects his medicines in horror and finally gets rid of him. Hoffmann now understands the nature of Antonia's malady and begs her to sing no more and she agrees reluctantly, as he leaves to avoid her father.\nDr Miracle appears behind Antonia, enticing her with the delights of a career as a singer and accusing Hoffmann of wanting to bury her in domesticity. When he summons up the voice of her mother which seems to be urging her to sing, she joins in an outpouring of song, collapses and dies.\nACT III\nA palace overlooking the Grand Canal in Venice\nNicklausse and the courtesan Giulietta sing the barcarolle. Schlemil, Giulietta's discarded lover, broods over Hoffmann's apparent success with Giulietta. Hoffmann derides the notion that he might fall in love with such a woman, but is overheard by her protector Dapertutto, who prepares to ensnare him.\nHe uses a huge diamond to entice Giulietta to obtain for him not the shadow (as in the case of Schlemil) but the reflection of Hoffmann. The jealous Schlemil challenges Hoffmann to a duel, but is killed when Dapertutto gives Hoffmann supernatural assistance. Nicklausse warns Hoffmann that he must flee, but he is now infatuated with Giulietta and refuses. Giulietta promises to follow him, but persuades him to leave his reflection with her. Dapertutto decides to remove Nicklausse by poisoning him, but it is Giulietta who drinks the poison. Her jester, Pitichinaccio, seizes the diamond.\nEPILOGUE\nLuther's tavern\nHoffmann is completely drunk and when his muse appears, he promises to be hers alone.

However, Edwin makes the faux pas of informing Silva that his parents would accept Silva ONLY if she pretends to have been divorced from Boni and therefore already entered society via an earlier marriage.

Sieglinde, Hunding's wife, gives him a drink and he explains that he has had to run from his enemies because his weapons failed him. Hunding arrives and extends hospitality to Siegmund, noticing the resemblance between him and Sieglinde.\nWhen asked his name he explains that a sad life qualifies him to be called Woeful. When he was young he and his father Wolf had returned home to find his mother murdered, the house burnt and his twin sister carried off. He and his father had lived homeless in the forest, until one day his father vanished. Seeking human company he had found only misfortune. His present predicament arose when he tried to rescue a girl who was being married against her will.

Sieglinde returns, telling him she has drugged Hunding and urging him to flee. She shows him a sword, embedded in the tree growing through the centre of the house, and tells him how it came to be there. When she was being married against her will to Hunding an old one-eyed man had appeared (the music identifies him as Wotan) and plunged the sword into the tree. No one has been able to move it but she is sure she knows who it is meant for.\nSiegmund and Sieglinde embrace. The door flies open, revealing the spring night. Siegmund compares their love to the union of love and spring. They recognise the resemblance between them and Siegmund reveals that his father's real name was W\u00e4lse.

Wotan tries to answer that an enforced marriage is less sacred than the love felt by Siegmund and Sieglinde; but she objects also on the grounds that they are brother and sister, as well as the fruit of Wotan's adulterous union with a mortal woman.\nHe tries to explain that his purpose was to create a free hero able to carry out a task forbidden to the gods, but she points out the fallacies in his arguments: Siegmund is not free, being protected by Wotan; even the sword has been left for him. He agrees unwillingly to her demands and agrees not to protect Siegmund but she demands that he also order Br\u00fcnnhilde not to protect him, sweeping aside his claim that Br\u00fcnnhilde is free to act as she chooses. He agrees dejectedly.\nWotan explains to Br\u00fcnnhilde how he had committed the wrong of paying for the building of Valhalla with Alberich's ring, instead of returning it to the Rhinemaidens. He sought further knowledge from Erda, after which she bore him the eight valkyries, their task being to assemble an army of heroes to help the gods in battle against Alberich, in case he should regain the ring, now guarded by the dragon (ex-giant) Fafner. Wotan is powerless to take the ring because of his treaty with Fafner, so he needs a free hero to perform the task, but he has been forced to admit that Siegmund is not free.\nHe has learnt that Alberich has sired a son.

The story begins with the revived Violante and her servant Roberto disguised as \"Sandrina\" and \"Nardo,\" and quietly working in the mansion of the town Podest\u00e0\u00a0. Violante discovers that Belfiore has become engaged to Arminda, the niece of the Podest\u00e0\u00a0, and when Belfiore confesses his lingering love for Violante, Arminda jealously conspires to abduct the other woman. When Violante is found, she and Belfiore lose their minds and believe themselves to be Greek gods. When they regain their senses Violante forgives the Count and they fly to each other's arms. Arminda returns to Cavalier Ramiro, her spurned suitor, and Roberto finds love with Serpetta, another servant of the Podest\u00e0\u00a0.\n Act I\nA garden with a wide staircase leading to the mansion of the Podest\u00e0\u00a0.\nThe Podest\u00e0\u00a0, Cavalier Ramiro and Serpetta descend the staircase as Sandrina and Nardo work in the garden. Together they praise the lovely day, but their happiness is feigned (\"Che lieto giorno\"). Sandrina is wretched because Don Anchise, the Podest\u00e0\u00a0, is in love with her. Nardo is frustrated by Serpetta, who teases him but refuses to respond to his affections. Ramiro is bitter after being tossed aside by Arminda, and, because she has set her own cap at the Podest\u00e0\u00a0, Serpetta is angry at Sandrina. The Podest\u00e0\u00a0 attempts to console Ramiro, but Ramiro can think of none but Arminda (\"Se l'augellin sen fugge\").

The Count then boasts of his deeds and ancestry to the Podest\u00e0\u00a0, tracing his family tree to Scipio, Cato and Marcus Aurelius (\"Da Scirocco\"). Don Anchise responds with a mixture of awe and skepticism, not caring who this buffoon of a Count is as long as he marries his niece.\nIn the garden, Arminda sees Sandrina and casually mentions her engagement to Belfiore. Stunned, Sandrina faints. When the Count arrives, Arminda leaves him to watch over Sandrina and rushes off to fetch her smelling salts.

Arminda overhears and confronts him, then leaves (\"Vorrei punirti indegno\"). Sandrina encounters Belfiore, and nearly betrays herself as Violante when she asks why he stabbed and deserted her. Belfiore is surprised by this outburst and once again sure that he has found his love, but Sandrina quickly reconstructs her disguise. She explains that she is not Violante, but that those were the Marchioness's dying words. Belfiore is nonetheless entranced, since \"Sandrina\" has the face of Violante, and he begins to serenade her (\"Care pupille\").

A red glow appears, but Zurga runs in to warn them that it is not the dawn, but their huts which are burning.\nAs they run off to rescue their children, he frees Leila and Nadir, telling them that he lit the fire himself.

Privately Talbot gives Leicester a portrait of Maria and a letter from her and Leicester resolves to free the woman he loves by any means. He gives Elisabetta the letter, which is a plea for a meeting with her, and he urges her to consent, pointing out that she can use a hunting party in the vicinity of Fotheringay as a pretext. His enthusiasm for her rival's cause reminds Elisabetta of Maria's attempts on the English throne and when Leicester waxes unwisely lyrical about Maria's charms, the Queen exults that she has been brought low.\nACT II\nThe grounds of Fotheringay Castle\nAccompanied by Anna, Maria walks in the park, rejoicing in her limited freedom, but remembering sadly the happy days of her youth in France. The sound of the approaching royal hunt terrifies her, and she regrets having asked Elisabetta for a meeting, but, supported by Leicester and his assurances that Elisabetta had been moved by the letter, she agrees to stay and face her.\nElisabetta also views the occasion with mixed feelings, on the one hand rejecting Cecil's urgings that she execute Maria and on the other enraged by the fervor with which Leicester argues her rival's case. As the queens confront one another, each is already convinced that the other is haughty, but Maria makes an effort and humbles herself to ask for clemency. Elisabetta is obdurate, and her references to Maria's murdered husband and aspersions on her honor provoke Maria, despite Leicester's attempts to calm her, into taunting Elisabetta with being a bastard and a \"vile, lascivious harlot.\" Furious, Elisabetta advises her to expect her death sentence, but Maria exults in her temporary triumph.\nACT III\nSCENE 1: The Palace of Westminster\nAlthough mortally affronted, Elisabetta hesitates to sign the death warrant, despite the urgings of Cecil that her safety and that of the realm depend on Maria's death. Only the arrival of Leicester provokes her into signing. His prayers for mercy only provoke her into ordering him to witness the execution.\nSCENE 2: Maria's apartment in Fotheringay\nMaria is still exultant over her humiliation of Elisabetta, though fearing that Leicester may be in danger from her wrath. Cecil brings the death warrant. She refuses his offer of a priest, but admits to Talbot that she is oppressed by the recollection of her sins. He reveals that he has taken holy orders so as to hear her confession.\nShe confesses to guilt over the murder of her husband, Darnley, and also seems to admit complicity in the Babington plot (not only to free her but elevate her to the English throne by murdering the Queen). Talbot gives her absolution.\nSCENE 3:  A room next to the execution chamber\nMaria's friends lament her fate, and she, facing death calmly, tries to comfort them and give them strength. As the cannon sounds the signal for her execution, Cecil asks for her last requests. She forgives Elisabetta and prays for a blessing on her and the kingdom. She tries to calm the grief-stricken Leicester and hopes that her innocent blood will placate the wrath of Heaven. She goes resolutely to her death as her friends grieve over her fate."},{"opera_title":"Gr\u00e4fin Mariza","composer":"Emmerich Kalman","synopsis":"Place: HungaryTime: Around 1924.\n Act I\nAt the castle of the countess Mariza\nAt the terrace of a castle with an adjacent park.

Tassilo hopes to earn a dowry for his sister Lisa - she doesn't know about the impoverishment of the family. He rather likes his service: he has never seen his mistress, just sends her the rents, and the servants and peasants treat him well. But this idyll is to come to an end: prince Populescu, an old Don Juan, comes and announces that countess Mariza will follow to celebrate her engagement there. Suddenly, she appears: A gorgeous, lively, but also a capricious young woman, who wants to disclose and celebrate the engagement with Baron Kolom\u00e1n Zsup\u00e1n. All guests have already arrived, but the engagement is only a fake, she secretly confesses to a friend, to get rid of her admirers.\nShe invented a fiancee to herself, based on the recollection of Strauss' operetta, \"The Gypsy Baron\". She announces that he was delayed by some business, and the engagement party will go on without him. But then, suddenly, he appears! Baron Zhupan read about his own \"engagement\" in the papers, and decided to come. He meets Mariza and they sing a duet together, \"Do not laugh, Mariza, but marry I should\". Mariza introduces her \"fiancee\" to the guests and they all go out to the park. There they surprise sad Tassilio, who sings an aria \"In the spring stillness a gypsy sings afar\", which he ends with a czardas. Both Mariza and the guests see it, and Mariza orders him to repeat it. He refuses, and the angry countess announces, that he is fired.\nThe guests are leaving the estate to go to the town, and get dissipated in cabarets. Maritza meets a young gypsy Manja who predicts that she will be very happy in love. \"One moon will pass over this Earth and Mariza will find her happiness\", she sings.

In a duet \"Come here and sit down\", they recollect their childhood.\nScene 2: A parlour in Mariza's house\nA month of her solitude has passed; guests are coming. They make fun of Tassilo. He writes a letter to his friend, to tell him that he endures a lot, but Lisa is his only close relative, and he will endure everything for her dowry. He stops writing it abruptly when Mariza comes in. Together, they sing a duet, a confession of love (\"My tender friend!\") Populescu tells Mariza that he saw her manager in the park with a pretty girl, and he finds the unfinished letter where Tassilo speaks about a dowry. Mariza does not know that Tassilo has a sister, so she sees him as a dowry-hunter. The finale of the Second act is a dramatic scene with an aria \"Hey, Mariza, be calm, hey, Mariza, endure this pain\", chaffing of the guests, perplexed Tassilo... Mariza humiliates and insults him, and throws him out. Lisa comes, runs towards her brother, and they leave together.

Superior Balthazar (bass), father of the Queen of Castile, enters with Fernand (tenor). Balthazar knows that Fernand is preoccupied by something. Fernand confesses that he has fallen in love with a beautiful, but as yet unknown, lady. His faith in God remains, but he wishes to leave the monastery in search of her. Balthazar angrily sends Fernand out of the monastery, warning him of the dangers of the outside world. He predicts that Fernand will one day return to the cloisters, a disappointed if wiser man.\n\tScene 2\n\tFernand has found his lady, L\u00e9onor (mezzo-soprano), declared his love and received it in return, but he is still unaware of her real identity. She has arranged to meet him on the island of Leon, to which he is brought blindfolded by boat. He is met by In\u00e8s (soprano), her companion, who impresses him with the need for secrecy. L\u00e9onor enters. She tells him that they can never marry and that they must not meet again, but nevertheless hands him a document to help him in his future.

Severely wounded in the battle, Tristan had made his way to Ireland where, under the assumed name of Tantris, he had been healed by the magical arts of Isolde, daughter of the king.\nIsolde, who had been betrothed to Morold, recognised Tristan (a piece broken out of his sword matched the fragment in Morold's head), but spared his life. On his return to Cornwall, to satisfy jealous courtiers that he was not aspiring to the throne, Tristan had persuaded his uncle to ask for the hand of Isolde.\nACT I\nOn board Tristan's ship returning from Ireland to Cornwall\nRaging at her fate, Isolde laments that she has not her mother's magic art of calling up a storm to wreck the ship. She is angry that Tristan keeps apart and sends her attendant Brang\u00e4ne to summon him. Tristan answers mildly that he must steer the ship; but his retainer Kurwenal answers roughly that Tristan is not Isolde's vassal, singing a vigorous song, taken up by the sailors and clearly audible to Isolde, celebrating Tristan's killing of Morold.\nIsolde tells Brang\u00e4ne how she had spared Tristan's life when he was in her power and complains bitterly that he has repaid her by seeking her as a bride for his old uncle, an insult that no one would have dared if Morold were alive and Cornwall still owed tribute to Ireland. Brang\u00e4ne reminds her of the love potion which her mother has given her, but Isolde thinks only of the poison which is in the same chest. When Kurwenal announces their imminent arrival in Cornwall and tells her to prepare to land, she gives him a message for Tristan: he must make amends for an unatoned wrong. She orders Brang\u00e4ne to pour the poison into a golden goblet.\nWhen Tristan arrives, she reproaches him with having avoided her during the voyage. He replies that he intended no discourtesy, but rather greater respect by keeping his distance from his uncle's bride. Isolde claims that Morold's blood still lies between them, as she was not party to any reconciliation. He offers his sword for her to kill him if Morold was so dear to her, but she says King Mark would hold it against her if she killed him. Instead she offers a drink of atonement. Understanding her intention, he drinks and Isolde seizes the goblet and drinks the remainder.\nBut Brang\u00e4ne has substituted the love potion and they fall into each other's arms, oblivious of all around them, as the ship reaches land and King Mark approaches to claim his bride.\nACT II\nA garden outside Isolde's chamber in King Mark's castle in Cornwall\nIsolde waits for Tristan as King Mark and his court leave on a hunt. She brushes aside Brang\u00e4ne's warning of danger, particularly from Melot, answering that he is Tristan's friend and has arranged the hunt so that Tristan can meet her. Brang\u00e4ne, suffering pangs of remorse for her part in the love between Tristan and Isolde, begs her to defer the meeting. Isolde says that not Brang\u00e4ne, but love itself (Frau Minne) was responsible for their love. She gives the signal by extinguishing a torch, telling Brang\u00e4ne to keep watch.\nTristan arrives and the lovers embrace, praising the night as the friend of their love, as opposed to the inimical day. Night, as Tristan explains, is equivalent to death and death will not part them, but unite them forever: only in death can their love be truly fulfilled. Brang\u00e4ne's warning of the approach of day goes unheeded and they are taken by surprise when Kurwenal rushes in, followed closely by King Mark, Melot and the court.\nKing Mark rejects Melot's claim to have saved him from shame, as nothing can remove the deep wound of Tristan's betrayal. He asks why Tristan, his dearest friend, has betrayed him, recalling that when his wife died he refused to marry again for Tristan's sake, intending him as his heir, bowing only to the wishes of his people whenTristan added his voice to theirs. Tristan had found him a peerless bride and his joy in her had made him more vulnerable than before.\nTristan replies that he is unable to offer an answer that his uncle would understand. He asks Isolde if she will follow him in death. She consents and he kisses her on the forehead, arousing the wrath of Melot, who draws his sword. Tristan draws his sword to defend himself, but lets it fall and is wounded by Melot.\nACT III\nTristan's ancestral castle in Brittany\nTristan, his wound still unhealed, lies under a tree as a shepherd plays a mournful tune while keeping watch for a ship which is bringing Isolde. Tristan wakes, but is unsure where he is. Kurwenal tells him that he has been brought home to recover from his wound. Tristan replies that he has already been in death's kingdom and only returned to find Isolde, who still tarries in the realm of light.\nKurwenal explains that Isolde has been sent for, as the only one able to heal his wound, as she had done before. In delirious excitement, Tristan thinks he sees the ship approaching. Finding this is not so, he is reminded by the shepherd's mournful tune of the same song which accompanied the griefs of his childhood, when he learnt that his father had died before he was born and his mother on giving birth to him. He curses the potion, bearing both love and death, which he himself had brewed. The shepherd's tune changes to a cheerful strain -the ship has been sighted. As Kurwenal goes to the shore to meet Isolde, Tristan tears off the bandage from his wound. He is only able to murmur Isolde's name, before dying at her feet. As she reproaches him for dying before her, another ship is sighted.\nKurwenal tries to bar the gate as King Mark and Melot arrive with Brang\u00e4ne. Kurwenal kills Melot and is killed by Mark's men, falling at his master's feet. The king grieves to find this carnage. He had been told of the potion by Brang\u00e4ne and had not only forgiven Tristan and Isolde but had come to unite them.

Obeying the goddess, Ascanio pretends to be a foreigner attracted by the beauties of the place. Aceste tells the shepherds that their valley will be the site of a fine city and that they will have a sovereign, Ascanio, before the day is out. He also informs Silvia that she will be Ascanio's bride, but she replies that she is in love with a young man she has seen in a dream.

Octavian's attempts to creep out are thwarted by the baron, who attempts to make an assignation with \"Mariandel\" at the same time as he explains his errand. He has come about his forthcoming marriage to Sophie Faninal, who is young and beautiful and has a rich father, who, however, has only recently been ennobled; but Ochs is satisfied that he has enough noble blood for two.\n\tHe has come to ask the Marschallin to choose a young relative to take a silver rose to Sophie as a token of betrothal, and for a recommendation to her notary, who is expected at her levee. His attempts to grab Mariandel cause the Marschallin to remark that his engagement has not cramped his style, and he boasts that he has no intention of curtailing his amorous exploits, adding that he keeps one of his bastard sons as his body servant. When the Marschallin suggests Octavian as the rose-bearer and shows him a picture, he is struck by the resemblance to Mariandel and the Marschallin has to pretend that \"she\" is Octavian's bastard sister, to forestall Ochs' curiosity when he meets Octavian.\n\tAt the levee, the Marschallin - among other things - has her hair done, gives alms to three noble orphans, refuses a gossip sheet offered by Valzacchi, an Italian intriguer, and listens to an Italian tenor, whose song is interrupted by the baron's arguments with the notary over the marriage settlement.\n\tComplaining that her hairdresser has made her look old, the Marschallin sends everyone away. Before leaving, Ochs manages to ask Valzacchi and his accomplice Annina to arrange for him to meet Mariandel, a commission they accept eagerly despite the fact that they have no idea who he means.

He has become a member of a notorious gang of highwaymen and cut-throats who terrorise the local community by robbery, extortion and rowdy singing at all hours of the day and night.\nBut already Carlo has tired of living a life of depravity and longs to return home to be with Amalia, his gentle cousin and lifelong sweetheart (O mio castel paterno \/ \"O castle of my fathers\"). He is awaiting the reply to a letter he has sent to his father begging for forgiveness for his recent misdemeanors.\nRolla and the other robbers arrive with the longed-for reply from the Count. Carlo's joy soon turns to sorrow, and then anger (Nell'argilla maledetta \/ \"Let my wrath plunge these swords into the accursed clay\"), as he finds that the letter is not from his father but from his younger brother Francesco, who warns him not to return home because, far from having forgiven Carlo, the old Count is intent on punishing him and locking him away.\nCarlo renounces his former life and swears an oath to remain with his new comrades for the rest of his days. The robbers unanimously elect him as their new leader.\nScene 2: A room in Count Moor's castle in Franconia.\nFrancesco is congratulating himself on having intercepted the letter from his brother to their father, knowing that Massimiliano would certainly have forgiven Carlo if he had received it. Now only the elderly, infirm Count stands between Francesco and the family title and estates, and he has devised a plan to hasten his father's death (La sua lampada vitale \/ \"The lamp of his life burns low\").\nHe forces Arminio, one of the castle servants, to disguise himself as a soldier recently arrived with tragic 'news' of Carlo's death, and sings his cabaletta, Tremate, o miseri \/ \"Tremble, you wretches, you shall see me in my true terrible aspect\".\nScene 3: Count Moor's bedroom in the castle.\nAmalia is watching over the ailing Count. Each of them is thinking affectionately of the missing Carlo (Lo sguardo avea degli angeli \/ \"His face had the smile of the angels\").\nFrancesco ushers the disguised Arminio into the room. Arminio describes how he fought alongside Carlo for King Frederick in a battle for the city of Prague, and how he saw him mortally wounded. Carlo's final act in this world was to inscribe a message, using his own blood, on the blade of his sword, that Amalia and Francesco should marry.\nAmalia and the Count are completely taken in; Massimiliano falls into a dead faint and Amalia, in a frenzy of hysteria, rushes offstage leaving a jubilant Francesco.\n Act 2\nScene 1: A graveyard near the castle.\nSeveral months have passed since the previous scene and Amalia enters to pray at Count Massimiliano's tomb (Tu del mio Carlo al seno \/ \"Blessed spirit, you have flown to the bosom of my Carlo\"). In the distance can be heard the sounds of a festive banquet hosted by Francesco, the new Count.\nArminio has followed Amalia from the castle because he is overcome by guilt at his part in Francesco's wicked scheming. He just has time to reveal that both Carlo and the old Count are still alive (provoking Amalia's cabaletta Carlo vive? O caro accento \/ \"Carlo lives?....O sweet words\") before he is disturbed by the arrival of Francesco and forced to flee the scene.\nFrancesco has also been searching for Amalia with the intention of asking her to marry him. Her scornful refusal provokes him into a rage and he becomes violent. Amalia pretends a change of heart and embraces him so that she can seize his dagger and fend him off before making her escape into the nearby forest.\nScene 2: A clearing in a Bohemian forest.\nRolla has been captured in Prague and the brigands are awaiting the return of their leader, Carlo, who has gone to rescue him. The rescue is achieved, but at the same time Carlo has managed to set fire to much of the city, resulting in armed citizens pursuing him. The scene ends with Carlo exhorting his gallant band to fight like wolves to save themselves.\n Act 3\nScene 1: A clearing in a Franconian forest.\nThe robbers sing of the pleasures of their criminal activities. They are now in the same forest as the distraught Amalia. Amalia fails to recognise her betrothed when he approaches her. Carlo reveals his identity, without mentioning his comrades, and there is a joyous reconciliation. Carlo is horrified when he learns of his brother's unsuccessful attack on her virtue.\nScene 2: Another clearing in the Franconian forest.\nCarlo is alone and contemplates his dismal future (Di ladroni attorniato \/ \"Surrounded by robbers, fettered to crime\"). He considers suicide, but decides that he must accept his dreadful fate and live on in loneliness and misery, reviled by all decent people.\nArminio enters stealthily and approaches some nearby ruins. Hearing a voice within the ruins, Carlo investigates and discovers the emaciated figure of his father. Massimiliano fails to recognise his son, but nevertheless describes to him how Francesco attempted to bury him alive after his collapse on hearing of Carlo's death (Un ignoto tre lune or saranno \/ \"An unknown - it will be three moons ago now - told me that my Carlo had been killed\"). Fortunately Arminio saved him and has kept him hidden in the ruins where Carlo has found him.\nLeaving the Count, Carlo calls on his band to storm the castle and capture his evil brother.\n Act 4\nScene 1: Another room in Count Moor's castle.\nFrancesco wakes after terrifying, guilt ridden nightmares (Pareami che sorto da lanto convito \/ \"I fancied that, having risen from a sumptuous banquet, I was sleeping...\"). He summons the local priest who refuses him absolution for his heinous crimes. At this point the brigands are heard storming the castle and Francesco rushes out, swearing that he will defy the very fires of Hell.\nScene 2: The second clearing in the Franconian forest.\nMassimiliano bewails Carlo's death, although he still does not recognise that the man standing in front of him is his favourite son. He blesses the \"unknown stranger\" for saving his life.\nThe robbers reappear and report that they did not manage to capture Francesco. This pleases Carlo who intends to change his ways. At this moment Amalia is dragged in by the brigands. Carlo is forced to admit to her, and to his father, his role as leader of the robbers. Massimiliano expresses his horror and despair, but Amalia declares that despite everything she still loves Carlo and wants to stay with him.\nAlthough Carlo has sworn to change his ways, he has also given his oath of lifelong allegiance to his band of robbers. He cannot allow the woman he loves to be dragged down into his world of degradation and disgrace and he cannot escape his own evil fate; he resolves this paradox by stabbing Amalia to death.

Seven years have passed since the Dutchman was last on land, and he is again free to search for a faithful woman who will save him from his fate. He has tried in vain to get himself killed by pirates or storms and longs for salvation or extinction.\nDaland comes out of his cabin and rebukes the steersman for not keeping good watch. He interrogates the Dutchman, who, learning that Daland's home is nearby, asks for hospitality, promising to pay well, and producing chests of jewels.

Lensky reflects with gentle melancholy on the passing of his youth, his possible impending death and his love for Olga.\n\tWhen Onegin appears (with only his manservant Guillot as his second, to the disapproval of Zaretsky, a stickler for correct duelling procedure), he and Lensky muse separately on the possibility of making up their quarrel, but decide they have gone too far to retreat. Onegin fires first and Lensky falls dead. Onegin is appalled.\nACT III\nScene 1: The ballroom of a nobleman's house in St Petersburg some years later\n\tA ball has just begun and Onegin, who is standing apart, muses on his life since the duel. He had fled his country estate and travelled but now, bored, he has returned, only to find himself at a ball. Among the guests is an elegant lady whom he recognises with astonishment as Tatyana. She notices him and tries to control her emotion. When he asks an old friend, Prince Gremin, who she is, he finds that she is Gremin's wife. Gremin bursts into a eulogy on Tatyana and his love for her.\n\tOnegin and Tatyana meet, both apparently calm, and they exchange a few civilities before she tells her husband she is tired and they leave. Onegin realises with astonishment that he is in love with her.\nScene 2: A drawing room in Prince Gremin's house\n\tTatyana holds a letter which Onegin has written to her declaring his love. She is upset that he has returned to disturb her peace of mind. Onegin enters to find her in tears and falls at her feet. She collects herself and reminds him of his rejection of her in the garden. When he exclaims that he now realises his mistake she asks if he finds the society woman a more suitable prize to add to his conquests than the simple country girl and he tries to convince her that his feelings are genuine. They both reflect on the happiness that has passed them by, and Tatyana tells Onegin that fate has decided otherwise: she is married and he must leave her.\n\tPassionately he tries to persuade her, but she reminds him that he is an honorable man. She admits that she does still love him but tells him that now she is married she will remain faithful to her husband. In vain he protests. She bids him farewell forever, and leaves him overcome by despair."},{"opera_title":"The Sorcerer","composer":"Arthur Sullivan","synopsis":"Act I\nThe villagers of Ploverleigh are preparing to celebrate the betrothal of Alexis Pointdextre, the son of the local baronet, and the blue-blooded Aline Sangazure (\"Ring forth, ye bells\"). Only a young village maiden named Constance Partlet seems unwilling to join in the happy mood, and we learn as she tells her mother that she is secretly in love with the local vicar, Dr. Daly (\"When he is here, I sigh with pleasure\"); and the cleric himself promptly soliloquises that he has been unlucky in love (\"The air is charged with amatory numbers\"). However, despite Mrs. Partlet's best attempts at matchmaking, the middle-aged Dr. Daly seems unable to conceive that a young girl like Constance would be interested in him.\nAt midnight that night (\"'Tis twelve, I think\"), the villagers awake and, under the influence of the potion, each falls in love with the first person of the opposite sex that they see (\"Why, where be Oi\"). All of the matches thus made are highly and comically unsuitable; Constance, for example, loves the ancient notary who performed the betrothal (\"Dear friends, take pity on my lot\"). However, Alexis is pleased with the results, and now asserts that he and Aline should drink the potion themselves to seal their own love. Aline is hurt by his lack of trust and refuses, offending him (\"Thou hast the power thy vaunted love\"). Alexis is distracted, however, by the revelation of his upper-class father having fallen for the lower-class Mrs Partlet, but he determines to make the best of this union (\"I rejoice that it's decided\").\nWells, meanwhile, is regretting the results that his magic has caused, and regrets them still more when the fearsome Lady Sangazure fixes on him as the object of her affections (\"Oh, I have wrought much evil with my spells\"). Aline decides to yield to Alexis' persuasion and drinks the potion without telling Alexis. Upon awaking, she inadvertently meets Dr. Daly first and falls in love with him (\"Oh, joyous boon\"). Alexis desperately appeals to Wells as to how the effects of the spell can be reversed. It turns out that this requires that either Alexis or Wells himself yield up his life to Ahrimanes. The people of Ploverleigh rally against the outsider from London and Wells, resignedly, bids farewell and is swallowed up by the underworld in a burst of flames (\"Or he or I must die\"). The spell broken, the villagers pair off according to their true feelings, and celebrate with another feast (reprise of \"Now to the banquet we press\")."},{"opera_title":"Die Dreigroschenoper","composer":"Kurt Weill","synopsis":"Prologue\n\tA street singer entertains the crowd with the illustrated murder ballad or B\u00e4nkelsang, entitled \"Die Moritat von Mackie Messer\" (\"Ballad of Mack the Knife\"). As the song concludes, a well-dressed man leaves the crowd and crosses the stage. This is Macheath, alias \"Mack the Knife\".\n\tAct 1\n\tThe story begins in the shop of Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum, the boss of London's beggars, who outfits and trains the beggars in return for a slice of their takings from begging. In the first scene, the extent of Peachum's iniquity is immediately exposed. Filch, a new beggar, is obliged to bribe his way into the profession and agree to pay over to Peachum 50 percent of whatever he made; the previous day he had been severely beaten up for begging within the area of jurisdiction of Peachum's protection racket. This acts as a depiction of capitalist exploitation, in a world where even beggars, individuals at the most exposed and lowest class, are constrained to pay protection.\n\tAfter finishing with the new man, Peachum becomes aware that his grown daughter Polly did not return home the previous night. Peachum, who sees his daughter as his own private property, concludes that she has become involved with Macheath. This does not suit Peachum at all, and he becomes determined to thwart this relationship and destroy Macheath.\n\tThe scene shifts to an empty stable where Macheath himself is preparing to marry Polly once his gang has stolen and brought all the necessary food and furnishings. No vows are exchanged, but Polly is satisfied, and everyone sits down to a banquet. Since none of the gang members can provide fitting entertainment, Polly gets up and sings \"Seer\u00e4uberjenny\", a revenge fantasy in which she is a scullery maid turning pirate queen to order the execution of her bosses and customers. The gang becomes nervous when the Chief of Police, Tiger Brown, arrives, but it's all part of the act; Brown had served with Mack in England's colonial wars and had intervened on numerous occasions to prevent the arrest of Macheath over the years. The old friends duet in the \"Kanonen-Song\" (\"Cannon Song\" or \"Army Song\"). In the next scene, Polly returns home and defiantly announces that she has married Macheath by singing the \"Barbarasong\" (\"Barbara Song\"). She stands fast against her parents' anger, but she inadvertently reveals Brown's connections to Macheath which they subsequently use to their advantage.\n\tAct 2\n\tPolly warns Macheath that her father will try to have him arrested. He is finally persuaded that Peachum has enough influence to do it and makes arrangements to leave London, explaining the details of his bandit \"business\" to Polly so she can manage it in his absence. Before he leaves town, he stops at his favorite brothel, where he sees his ex-lover, Jenny. They sing the \"Zuh\u00e4lterballade\" (\"Pimp's Ballad\") about their days together, but Macheath doesn't know Mrs Peachum has bribed Jenny to turn him in. Despite Brown's apologies, there's nothing he can do, and Macheath is dragged away to jail. After he sings the \"Ballade vom angenehmen Leben\" (\"Ballad of the Pleasant Life\"), another girlfriend, Lucy (Brown's daughter) and Polly show up at the same time, setting the stage for a nasty argument that builds to the \"Eifersuchtsduett\" (\"Jealousy Duet\"). After Polly leaves, Lucy engineers Macheath's escape. When Mr Peachum finds out, he confronts Brown and threatens him, telling him that he will unleash all of his beggars during Queen Victoria's coronation parade, ruining the ceremony and costing Brown his job.\n\tAct 3\n\tJenny comes to the Peachums' shop to demand her money for the betrayal of Macheath, which Mrs Peachum refuses to pay. Jenny reveals that Macheath is at Suky Tawdry's house. When Brown arrives, determined to arrest Peachum and the beggars, he is horrified to learn that the beggars are already in position and only Mr Peachum can stop them. To placate Peachum, Brown's only option is to arrest Macheath and have him executed. In the next scene, Macheath is back in jail and desperately trying to raise a sufficient bribe to get out again, even as the gallows are being assembled. Soon it becomes clear that neither Polly nor the gang members can, or are willing to, raise any money, and Macheath prepares to die. Then a sudden and intentionally comical reversal: a messenger on horseback arrives to announce that Macheath has been pardoned by the queen and granted a title, a castle and a pension. The cast then sings the Finale, which ends with a plea that wrongdoing not be punished too harshly as life is harsh enough.\n\tMusical numbers\n\tPrelude1 Ouverture2 Die Moritat von Mackie Messer (\"The Ballad of Mack the Knife\" - Ausrufer - Street singer)First Act3 Morgenchoral des Peachum (Peachum's Morning Choral - Peachum, Mrs Peachum)4 Anstatt dass-Song (Instead of Song - Peachum, Mrs Peachum)5 Hochzeits-Lied (Wedding Song - Four Gangsters)6 Seer\u00e4uberjenny (Pirate Jenny - Polly)7 Kanonen-Song (Cannon Song - Macheath, Brown)8 Liebeslied (Love Song - Polly, Macheath)9 Barbarasong (Barbara Song - Polly)10 I.

Frederick of Telramund explains that on his deathbed the Duke of Brabant had entrusted to his care his two children, Elsa and Godfrey, on the understanding that he would marry Elsa and be guardian to Godfrey. But Godfrey has disappeared, Elsa is suspected of doing away with him and Telramund has married Ortrud, daughter of Radbold, King of the Frisians.\nIn her name and his own he claims the dukedom and accuses Elsa of fratricide and of having a secret lover. The king agrees to judge the case and Elsa is summoned. Her only answer to the accusations is to relate a dream in which a hero appeared in answer to her need. To him she will entrust her cause. The king decrees trial by combat, and the herald calls for a champion to appear.\nA knight appears, in a boat drawn by a swan. He says he has been sent by God to be Elsa's champion. She accepts him as champion and husband, agreeing to his condition that she must never ask his name or lineage or where he came from. Telramund is defeated in the duel, but the stranger knight spares his life and is acclaimed by the populace.\nACT II\nThe fortress of Antwerp\nTelramund blames Ortrud for his downfall, as she had told him that she saw Elsa drown her young brother, but she convinces him that he was defeated by magic rather than divine intervention. She claims that the stranger's magic would fail if he could be made to reveal his name - or even if the tip of a finger were to be cut off.\nAs only Elsa can ask him to reveal his name, Ortrud plans to undermine her confidence. Elsa appears on the balcony and Otrud, calling to her from the darkness, succeeds in winning her pity, invoking the pagan gods in triumph as Elsa prepares to let her in. Ortrud begs Elsa to intercede for Telramund and suggests that as the stranger arrived by magic, so he may leave by magic, but Elsa's faith is unshaken.\nAt dawn the herald proclaims the banishment of Telramund and announces that the king has invested the crown of Brabant in Elsa's husband, who will lead the Brabantians into battle. Four nobles mutter their resentment at this decision and Telramund offers to lead them in rebellion.\nAs Elsa is about to enter the church for her wedding Ortrud claims that she must yield pride of place to her, since her husband has been falsely accused and is of noble birth, whereas no one knows anything about Elsa's husband. Claiming that he would be revealed a fraud if he had to divulge the source of his power, she challenges Elsa to ask the question. Telramund accuses the strange knight of witchcraft and asks his name and lineage, but he is answerable to Elsa alone. Telramund whispers to Elsa that if she were to let him cut off the tip of the stranger's finger his secret would be known and he would never leave her. She rejects the advice and goes into the church with her husband, who orders Telramund and Ortrud to leave.\nACT III\nThe bridal chamber\nFollowing the good wishes of their attendants, Elsa and her husband are left alone for the first time. Their delight in one another is soon undermined by her regrets that she cannot call her husband by his name and her fears that he may leave her. A hysterical vision of the swan returning to take him away leads to the fatal question. Telramund bursts in with his followers and is killed by Lohengrin, who tells the nobles to bring the body before the king. He calls Elsa's ladies to dress her and tells her he will answer her question before the king.\nThe banks of the Scheldt\nThe king thanks the people for their support in defending Germany against the heathen. The body of Telramund is carried in, followed by Elsa and her husband, who tells the king he will not be able to lead the people of Brabant into battle. He is absolved from blame for Telramund's death.\nExplaining that Elsa has been tricked into asking the forbidden question, he answers it: he is one of the champions of the Holy Grail, who are sent out into the world to defend the cause of right. But they must leave once their identities are known. He is Lohengrin, son of Parsifal, who wears the crown of the Grail. He prophesies that Germany will never be conquered by the eastern hordes. The swan appears and Lohengrin bids farewell to Elsa, telling her that if he had been able to stay, her bother Godfrey, who is not dead, would have returned.\nOrtrud exults at her success in driving Lohengrin away and that Godrey must remain in the form of the swan as a result of her witchcraft. Lohengrin kneels in prayer and when he takes the chain from the neck of the swan, it is transformed into Godfrey. Elsa falls lifeless as Lohengrin leaves, his boat now drawn by a white dove."},{"opera_title":"Lombardi Prima Crociata","composer":"Giuseppe Verdi","synopsis":"Time: 1096\/97Place: Milan, in and around Antioch, and near Jerusalem\n Act 1: La Vendetta\nScene 1: A square outside the church of Sant' Ambrogio in Milan\nThe two sons of Lord Folco, Pagano and Arvino, are reconciled, having previously feuded over which man would win the hand of Viclinda. Pagano, who once threatened the life of his brother, has returned from exile. A throng gathers in front of the church of Sant'Ambrogio to celebrate. Viclinda, now Arvino's wife, and their daughter Giselda are on hand to witness the reconciliation. A crusade to the Holy Land is announced and Arvino is to lead it. Pagano secretly vents his enduring frustration to Pirro, Arvino's squire: he still desires Viclinda (Sciagurata! hai tu creduto \/ \"Wretched woman! Did you believe that I could forget you...\"). As nuns sing in the background, Pirro and a gang of cut-throats agree to help Pagano take Viclinda for himself.\nScene 2: The Folco palace\nViclinda and Giselda are concerned about Pagano and his supposed reformation. Arvino asks them to watch his elderly father, Lord Folco, who is spending the night in Arvino's chambers. Giselda prays (Aria: Salve Maria \/ \"Hail Mary!\"). Pirro and Pagano and their assassins storm the palace. Pagano draws his sword and enters Arvino's chambers. He emerges with a bloody sword and with Viclinda in his custody. Arvino suddenly appears and Pagano is shocked to learn that in the darkness he has killed his father, not his brother (Orror! \/ \"Horror! Dreadful monster of Hell...\").

So Pagano is once again sent into exile.\n Act 2: L'uomo della Caverna\nScene 1: Acciano's palace in Antioch\nAcciano and representatives from surrounding territories plot their continued resistance to the marauding crusaders. They have captured Giselda, who is now held captive within Acciano's harem. Sofia, Acciano's head wife and a secret Christian, enters with her son Oronte. Oronte has fallen in love with the captive Giselda (Aria: La mia letizia infondere \/ \"Would that I could instill my gladness into her dear heart\").

A man appears at the cave and asks the hermit how he may receive forgiveness for his past sins. The man is Pirro, who has become a confidante of Acciano and now controls the gates of Antioch. The hermit counsels Pirro that he will achieve forgiveness if he opens the gates to the approaching crusaders. Thereafter, the crusaders, led by Arvino, appear at the cave. The hermit learns that Arvino's daughter has been captured by Acciano. The hermit assures them that they will succeed in taking Antioch.\nScene 3: Acciano's harem\nThe members of the harem sing of Giselda's luck in attracting the attentions of Oronte. As Giselda prays (Aria: Oh madre, dal cielo \/ \"O mother, from heaven hear my lament\") sudden shouts warn that the crusaders have invaded Antioch. Sofia rushes in to say that both Acciano and Oronte have been killed. Arvino enters with the hermit. Sofia identifies Arvino as the murderer of her husband and son. Giselda is horrified and recoils at her father's attempted embrace. She declares that this crusade was not the will of God. Arvino draws his sword and threatens to kill her for her blasphemy, but he is stopped by the hermit and Sofia.

He tells Giselda and Oronte that their love is sinful but may be purified by Oronte's conversion and baptism. The hermit completes the baptism, and Giselda laments as Oronte dies from his wounds, promising to see her in heaven (Trio: Qual volutta trascorrere \/ \"What wondrous pleasure I feel\").\n Act 4: Il Santo Sepolcro\nScene 1: A cave, near Jersulam\nAs Giselda dreams, Oronte appears to her in a vision and tells her that God has granted his prayer: the crusaders will find strength in the waters of the fountain of Siloam (Aria: In cielo benedetto \/ \"Through you, Gisleda, I am blessed in heaven\"). Giselda wakes and sings of her miraculous vision (Aria: Qual prodigio . . . Non fu sogno! \/ \"A miracle!... It was not a dream\").\nScene 2: The Lombards' tents\nThe crusaders and pilgrims are despairing that God has abandoned them in the desert (O signore, dal tetto natio \/ \"O Lord, Thou dids't call us\").

A detachment of Chinese troops marches on to the stage and sings a 1930s Red Army song, The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points of Attention. As the soldiers wait, an airplane taxis and lands on the stage - the Nixons and Henry Kissinger disembark and are greeted by Chou Enlai. As Nixon is introduced to various Chinese officials by Chou, he sings of his hopes and fears for his historic visit.\n\tLater, Richard Nixon and Kissinger visit Mao's study along with Chou. While Nixon attempts to set out his stall with a simple and simplistic vision of peace between America and China, Mao wishes to discuss philosophy with Nixon and speaks in riddles. The visit is not entirely a success, and the elderly Mao is soon worn out. Chou departs with Nixon and Kissinger.\n\tOn the first night of the visit, a great feast for the American delegation is held in the Great Hall of the People. The Nixons and Chou gradually relax in one another's company as good food and strong drink takes its effect. Chou rises to make a toast to the American delegation, full of fulsome praise and wishes for peaceful co-existence. Nixon responds in kind, congratulating the Chinese for their hospitality and recanting his previous opposition to China. The party continues with mutual compliments and toasting.\n\tAct Two\n\tPat Nixon is being escorted to various showcases of contemporary Chinese life - a glass factory, a health centre, pig farm and a primary school. However, the language of Pat's Chinese guides is stilted and formal - they hint darkly of the repressive side of Chinese life that lies underneath the fa\u00e7ade shown to foreign dignitaries. Pat sings an aria of her own hopes for the future, a peaceful future of modesty and good neighbourliness, a future based on the values of the American heartland.\n\tLater that night, the Nixons attend the Chinese opera, to see a piece written by Madam Mao called The Red Detachment of Women. The piece is a simplistic display of politicised music-theater, with the oppressed peasants of a tropical island saved from their brutal landlord by heroic women of the Red Army.\n\tHowever, somehow the main characters are drawn into the opera, each revealing their true nature, with Pat Nixon defending the weak, Kissinger siding with the brutal landlord and Madam Mao's desire to save the peasants at all costs leading her to become more brutal than the landlord was in the first place. Eventually, a riot develops on stage with Chou and Madam Mao on opposite sides - the opera has become a rerun of the Cultural Revolution.\n\tAct Three\n\tOn the Americans' final night in Beijing, it has become apparent to all that there will be no great breakthrough the Shanghai Communique is no more than words, a face-saving formula for the world's press to buy into. The main characters look back over their lives the Maos and the Nixons look back to the struggles of their early years together, Richard Nixon recalls his younger days as a sailor. Only Chou looks deeper, asking \"how much of what we did was good?\", before casting doubts aside and wearily carrying on with his work."},{"opera_title":"Hamlet","composer":"Ambroise Thomas","synopsis":"Place: Denmark at the castle of Elsinore.\n Act 1\nScene 1: The Coronation Hall\nThe royal Danish court is celebrating the coronation of Queen Gertrude who has married Claudius, brother of the late King Hamlet.

After the church service Eva contrives a few minutes with Walther to explain, in answer to his eager questions, that, although she loves him, she is not free to marry. Her father has decided to offer her hand to the winner of a mastersinging contest to be held the next day, for the festival of St John, Midsummer's Day.\nEva's maid and companion, Magdalena, arranges for her sweetheart, the apprentice David, to prepare Walther for the contest, since only mastersingers are eligible to compete. David is horrified to discover that Walther knows nothing at all about the art of mastersinging and that he hopes to reach in one day a stage which requires years of painful study - such as he is undergoing himself as he studies singing as well as shoemaking under Hans Sachs, the greatest of the mastersingers.\nOther apprentices are meanwhile arranging the church for a singing test. The mastersingers begin to arrive. First are Pogner and Beckmesser, the town clerk who wants to marry Eva and is trying to urge her father to put in a good word for him. Walther takes Pogner aside and explains that he wants to join the mastersingers guild. Beckmesser eyes him off suspiciously.\nWhen the meeting begins Pogner announces that he intends to give his daughter and her dowry as a prize in the festival song contest. Sachs suggests that the people ought to have some say in the judging, since the contest is to be public, An argument develops between Sachs and Beckmesser, who clearly regards Sachs, a widower, as a rival for Eva's hand. Sachs enrages him by answering that they are both too old for a young girl. Pogner then presents Walther as a candidate for the guild. To prove his suitability he has to sing a song but is failed by Beckmesser, who acts as examiner.\nSachs defends the song and accuses Beckmesser of not being objective, but the other masters also reject the song, finding it too free and not in accordance with the strict rules of their craft. In the ensuing argument Beckmesser complains that Sachs should spend less time on poetry and more on the pair of shoes he has ordered for the next day.\nWalther, failed in the test, leaves the church angrily.\nACT II\nA street between the houses of Pogner and Hans Sachs, the evening of the same day\nEva, having learned of Walther's failure to become a master, goes along to Sachs to find out the full story. He, still reflecting on the strange beauty of Walther's song, tests Eva's feelings. She responds so hotly to his disparaging remarks about Walther that he realises she loves him. He is now able to plan how to help the lovers.\nWhen Walther comes along to find Eva he is still very angry with the masters and persuades Eva to elope with him.\u2028She goes inside to change clothes with Magdalena, so that she can escape unnoticed and also so that Magdalena can take her place at the window to listen to a serenade which Beckmesser is supposed to be singing to her that night.\nWalther and Eva wait in the street for a chance to slip away but Sachs, inside his shop, has heard their plans and is determined to stop them from taking such a rash step, so he keeps a light shining across the street so they cannot get past unobserved. When Beckmesser begins his serenade Sachs begins to hammer and sing a vigorous cobbling song. To Beckmesser's objections he agrees to stop singing but points out that he has to keep hammering - to finish the shoes Beckmesser has been complaining about.\nAfter some argument it is agreed that Sachs is to act as marker for Beckmesser's song, only hammering when he makes a mistake. But when Beckmesser sings the hammering is so fast and furious that the shoes are finished before the song.\u2028Then David sees Magdalena at the window and rushes out jealously to attack Beckmesser. People open their windows to see what is going on. Apprentices from rival guilds rush into the street and a general brawl develops, only broken off by the appearance of the night watchman.\nSachs manages to bundle Eva into her own house and pull Walther with him into his house just as they are on the point of running away in the confusion.\nACT III\nScene 1: Inside Sachs' workshop, the next morning\nHans Sachs is in a reflective mood, thinking of the midsummer madness of the night before, but still eager to help Eva and Walther. Learning that Walther has had a dream he encourages him to make it into a song, teaching as he goes along how to frame it so as not to outrage too violently the mastersingers' rules and writing it down himself as Walther sings it. With the final stanza still uncomposed they go into another room to change their clothes, leaving the song on the bench.\nBeckmesser comes in and pockets the song gleefully, thinking it is by Sachs. To his surprise, Sachs does not object when he finds out, but makes him a present of it. He is torn between gratitude, feeling certain that a song by Sachs will win him the prize, and distrust that Sachs has something up his sleeve - as indeed he does, though all Beckmesser's guesses are wide of the mark. He goes off to learn the song.\nEva comes in, ostensibly to complain about her shoes. Walther is inspired by her presence to finish the song, which Sachs, putting his own feelings for Eva aside and satisfied with his matchmaking, pronounces to be a mastersong. Eva and Walther are deeply grateful to him for his help. Sachs calls David and Magdalena in to help celebrate the new song and also promotes David to the status of journeyman, which means that he and Magdalena will be able to get married. They all set off for the festival.\nScene 2: The festival meadow\nThe apprentices of the different guilds dance and sing while waiting for the arrival of the masters. Then the proper business of the day begins: the townspeople sing an ode of praise to Sachs, who thanks them and makes the public announcement of the prize to be awarded by Pogner, exhorting those who aspire to the prize to be sure they are worthy of it in all respects.\nThe first competitor is Beckmesser, who makes a hopeless mess of Walther's song. In the face of general derision he defends himself by claiming that the song is by Sachs. Sachs denies this and tells them that the song is beautiful but has been ruined by Beckmesser. To prove his case he calls on the real composer to sing the song, thus giving Walther a chance to be heard - which otherwise, as an outsider, he would not have had.\nWith the unfair assistance of a full orchestra and chorus to back him, compared to Beckmesser's solitary lute, he sings his song, to general acclaim. Eva crowns him with the victor's garland and Pogner offers him the chain of a mastersinger. He rejects it angrily, but Sachs reproves him, telling him to honor the masters because their care has kept the art of poetry alive."},{"opera_title":"J\u00e9rusalem","composer":"Giuseppe Verdi","synopsis":"Time: 1095 and 1099 ADPlace: Toulouse (Act 1); Palestine, near Jerusalem (Acts 2 - 4)\n Act 1\nScene 1: The palace of the Count of Toulouse\nLate at night H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is with her lover, Gaston.

Roger hurries off to help them. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Isaure come down the pathway seeking the hermit who they think can tell them of Gaston's fate.

At that moment, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, having been captured in the city, is brought in. The couple pretends not to know one another, but the Emir is suspicious. However, they are left alone and are joyous in their reunion, until Gaston attempts to dissuade H\u00e9l\u00e8ne from associating with him in his dishonor (Aria: Dans la honte et l'\u00e9pouvante \/ \"You cannot share in the horror and shame of my wandering life!\").

In despair, she considers the uselessness of her life (Aria: Que m'importe la vie \/ \"What does life matter to me in my extreme unhappiness\" and Mes plaintes mes plaintes sont vaines \/ \"My laments are in vain\").\nGaston has escaped and rushes in to find H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but their joy is short-lived as the Crusaders, led by the Count, burst into the room and demand the Gaston's death, still believing that he was responsible for the attempt on the Count's life. Defiantly, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne challenges the Crusaders (Aria: Non...non votre rage \/ \"No...no, your anger, your unworthy outrage\") as well as her father (\"The shame and crime are yours!\").

His challenge is accepted by the Forces of Good.\n Act 1\nScene 1\nThe aged Dr. Faust and his pupil Wagner are watching the Easter celebrations in the main square in Frankfurt. Faust senses that they are being followed by a mysterious friar, about whom he senses something evil. Wagner dismisses his master's feelings of unease and as darkness falls they return to Faust's home\nScene 2\nFaust is in his study, deep in contemplation. His thoughts are disturbed in dramatic fashion by the sudden appearance of the sinister friar, whom he now recognizes as a manifestation of the Devil (Mefistofele). Far from being terrified, Faust is intrigued and enters into a discussion with Mefistofele culminating in an agreement by which he will give his soul to the devil on his death in return for worldly bliss for the remainder of his life.\n Act 2\nScene 1\nRestored to his youth, Faust has infatuated Margareta, an unsophisticated village girl. She is unable to resist his seductive charms and agrees to drug her mother with a sleeping draught and meet him for a night of passion.

She has been imprisoned for poisoning her mother with the sleeping draught supplied by Faust and for drowning the baby she had borne him. Faust begs Mefistofele to help them escape together. They enter the cell and at first Margareta does not recognize her rescuers. Her joy at being reunited with Faust turns to horror when she sees Mefistofele and recognizes that he is the Devil. Refusing to succumb to further evil, Margareta begs for divine forgiveness. She collapses to the cell floor as the Celestial choir proclaims her redemption.\n Act 4\nMefistofele has now transported Faust back in time to Ancient Greece. Helen of Troy and her followers are enjoying the luxurious and exotic surroundings on the banks of a magnificent river. Faust, attired more splendidly than ever, is easily able to win the heart of the beautiful princess. In a passionate outpouring they declare their undying love and devotion to each other.\n Epilogue\nBack in his study Faust, once more an old man, reflects that neither in the world of reality or of illusion was he able to find the perfect experience he craved. He feels that the end of his life is close, but desperate for his final victory, Mefistofele urges him to embark on more exotic adventures. For a moment Faust hesitates, but suddenly seizing his Bible he cries out for God's forgiveness.

Samson tries to revive the Israelites' morale and faith in God (\"Arr\u00eatez, \u00f4 mes fr\u00e8res\") in a rousing aria set against the chorus's continuous prayer. Abimelech, the Philistine governor, appears and taunts the Israelites, saying that they are helpless because their god has abandoned them.

The sun lights up the gold which they are supposed to be guarding.\nUnwisely, they let Alberich know that a ring forged from the gold will give its maker power to rule the world, the only condition being that he must forswear love. The frustrated Alberich is easily able to fulfil what they regard as an impossible condition; he seizes the gold, pronounces a curse on love and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens bewailing their loss.\nScene 2: An open space on the mountain tops\nWotan is admiring his new castle, Valhalla, built for the gods by the giant brothers Fasolt and Fafner, but his wife Fricka is concerned about the price he has promised them - the goddess Freia, who runs in, pursued by the giants, claiming her as their reward. Wotan laughs at them, saying that he never had any intention of handing her over; but the terms of the agreement have been inscribed on the shaft of his spear, the symbol of his power, and Fasolt warns him that his power will be undermined if he fails to abide by his own treaty.\nFasolt wants Freia for her own sake, but Fafner is more interested in the practical aspect: the giants will gain an advantage if the gods are deprived of the youth they derive from Freia's golden apples.

He reports that his world-wide search for something the giants might accept in place of Freia was in vain: he found no one who did not prize the love of woman above everything - with one exception: Alberich, who had forsworn love to make a ring from the gold he stole from the Rhine.

Mime tries to keep the helmet, but Alberich seizes it and beats him, as he laments to Wotan and Loge.\nAlberich is suspicious of the visitors and warns them that he means to use his new power against the gods. Loge persuades him to show off the helmet. He changes himself into a dragon and they pretend terror, flattering him into showing how small he can make himself. He changes into a toad and is easily captured.\nScene 4: The same as Scene 2, except that all is hidden by mist\nWotan tells Alberich that the price of his freedom is the gold, including both the helmet and the ring, which he had hoped to retain. Seizing the ring, Wotan proclaims himself the mightiest of all lords. Set free, Alberich invokes a fearful curse on the ring: it will bring death and destruction on all who wear it.\nThe mists clear, revealing the waiting gods. The giants bring Freia back, but refuse to part with her until the gold has been heaped up in such a way that she is no longer visible. Like Alberich, Wotan had hoped to retain the helmet and the ring; but both are demanded to cover cracks through which Friea is still visible. He gives up the helmet, but refuses to part with the ring.\nThe earth goddess Erda appears and warns him to give up the ring to escape its curse, proclaiming that the doom of the gods themselves is at hand. Wotan wishes to know more, but she disappears. Wotan hands over the ring. Freia is free and the gods' youth is restored, but the giants quarrel over the gold and Fafner kills Fasolt. Wotan now realises the power of Alberich's curse.\nDonner disperses the clouds with a blow of his hammer, which causes a thunderclap, and the rainbow bridge appears, leading to Valhalla. The gods cross it, with Loge unsure whether to throw in his lot with them. The Rhinemaidens can be heard lamenting their lost gold and the faithlessness of the gods."},{"opera_title":"La Damnation de Faust","composer":"Hector Berlioz","synopsis":"Wikisource has original text related to this article:\n Part I\nThe aging scholar Faust contemplates the renewal of nature. Hearing peasants sing and dance, he realizes that their simple happiness is something he will never experience. An army marches past in the distance (Hungarian March). Faust doesn't understand why the soldiers are so enthusiastic about glory and fame.\n Part II\nDepressed, Faust has returned to his study. Even the search for wisdom can no longer inspire him. Tired of life, he is about to commit suicide when the sound of church bells and an Easter hymn remind him of his youth, when he still had faith in religion. Suddenly M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s appears, ironically commenting on Faust's apparent conversion. He offers to take him on a journey, promising him the restoration of his youth, knowledge, and the fulfillment of all his wishes. Faust accepts.\nM\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s and Faust arrive at Auerbach's tavern in Leipzig, where Brander, a student, sings a song about a rat whose high life in a kitchen is ended by a dose of poison. The other guests offer an ironic \"Amen,\" and M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s continues with another song about a flea that brings his relatives to infest a whole royal court (Song of the Flea). Disgusted by the vulgarity of it all, Faust demands to be taken somewhere else.\nOn a meadow by the Elbe, M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s shows Faust a dream vision of a beautiful woman named Marguerite, causing Faust to fall in love with her. He calls out her name, and M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s promises to lead Faust to her. Together with a group of students and soldiers, they enter the town where she lives.\n Part III\nFaust and M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s hide in Marguerite's room. Faust feels that he will find in her his ideal of a pure and innocent woman (\"Merci, doux crepuscule!\"). Marguerite enters and sings a ballad about the King of Thule, who always remained sadly faithful to his lost love (\"Autrefois, un roi de Thul\u00e9\"). M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s summons spirits to enchant and deceive the girl and sings a sarcastic serenade outside her window, predicting her loss of innocence. When the spirits have vanished, Faust steps forward. Marguerite admits that she has dreamed of him, just as he has dreamed of her, and they declare their love for each other. Just then, M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s bursts in, warning them that the girl's reputation must be saved: the neighbors have learned that there is a man in Marguerite's room and have called her mother to the scene. After a hasty goodbye, Faust and M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s escape.\n Part IV\nFaust has seduced, then abandoned Marguerite, who still awaits his return (\"D'amour L'ardente flamme\"). She can hear soldiers and students in the distance, which reminds her of the night Faust first came to her house. But this time he is not among them.\nFaust calls upon nature to cure him of his world-weariness (\"Nature immense, imp\u00e9n\u00e9trable et fi\u00e8re\"). M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s appears and tells him that Marguerite is in prison. She has accidentally given her mother too much of a sleeping potion, killing the old woman, and will be hanged the next day. Faust panics, but M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s claims he can save her-if Faust relinquishes his soul to him. Unable to think of anything but saving Marguerite, Faust agrees. The two ride off on a pair of black horses.\nThinking they are on their way to Marguerite, Faust becomes terrified when he sees demonic apparitions. The landscape becomes more and more horrible and grotesque, and Faust finally realizes that M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s has taken him directly into hell. Demons and damned spirits greet M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s in a mysterious infernal language and welcome Faust among them.\nHell has fallen silent after Faust's arrival - the torment he suffers is unspeakable. Marguerite is saved and welcomed into heaven."},{"opera_title":"Eine Nacht in Venedig","composer":"Johann Strauss jr","synopsis":"Act 1\n\tIt is an evening in eighteenth-century Venice. In a square on the Grand Canal, with a view across to the Ducal Palace and the Isle of San Giorgio, people stroll around as the sun goes down, while the tradeswomen call out their wares. The young Neapolitan macaroni cook Pappacoda observes that, for all the splendours of the city, Venetians do not have everything without their macaroni cook. \"Macaroni as long as the Grand Canal, with as much cheese as there is sand in the Lido\" - that is what Pappacoda offers. The young man is approached by Enrico, a naval officer, enquiring whether the Senator Delacqua is at home. When he is told that he is at a sitting of the Senate, Enrico sees it as an opportunity for a few private minutes with the Senator's young wife Barbara. However, she also is out, so Enrico slips Pappacoda a coin to give Barbara a letter with the message that Enrico will be ready for her at nine o'clock that evening.\n\tAs the people watch, a boat arrives carrying Annina, a fisher-girl, who is hawking her fruitti di mare. Pappacoda greets her, hinting that what has really brought her hither is the imminent arrival of the Duke of Urbino, and more particularly his barber Caramello, Annina's sweetheart. \"Caramello is a monster, a ne'er-do-well, and a conceited blockhead into the bargain\", she pouts. \"Stupidity is no hindrance to love\", Pappacoda retorts, sampling an oyster. \"After all, I'm passionately in love with Ciboletta, Signora Delacqua's pretty cook - a girl as stupid as this oyster, and yet just as appetising, just as worthy of catching!\"\n\tWhen Barbara Delacqua returns home, Pappacoda gives her the message from Enrico and receives another tip for his troubles. Annina departs with Barbara, leaving Pappacoda to greet his own girlfriend, Ciboletta. She is wondering when they are going to get married, and he promises that they will do so just as soon as he gets a position in service.\n\tThe senators return from a stormy session, discussing the banquet that the Duke of Urbino is to give today when he arrives for his annual Carnival-time visit to Venice. The Duke is a notorious womaniser and has already cast his roving eye on Barbara, so Delacqua has taken the precaution of arranging for his wife to be taken by gondola to Murano to stay with an old abbess aunt in the convent there.\n\tThe Duke's arrival is signalled by the appearance of a gondola carrying his personal barber, Caramello, who is warmly greeted by the crowd. He proceeds to show off his close acquaintance with the Duke and rounds things off with an agile tarantella for good measure. He quickly spots Annina, but she is not too pleased that he has practically ignored her for the past year. She becomes interested enough when the subject of their talk turns to marriage, but Caramello explains that he is eager to obtain a position as the Duke's steward before committing himself to matrimony.\n\tIn pursuit of amorous adventures on his master's behalf Caramello has learned with interest from Pappacoda that a gondolier is due to take Barbara Delacqua to Murano at 9 p.m. What he does not know is that his own girlfriend, Annina, has been persuaded by Barbara to take her place in the gondola, so that Barbara may spend her time with Enrico Piselli. Annina is determined to be back within the hour so that she may join in the Carnival dancing with Caramello, Pappacoda and Ciboletta in masks borrowed from their masters.\n\tThe Duke arrives and greets Venice and its people. He loves them all, he tells them, though it appears that he seems to love the pretty girls rather more than the rest. To the Duke's great delight, Caramello reveals to him his plan to take the place of the gondolier in the gondola calling for Barbara. Instead of taking her to Murano, he will then deliver her to the Duke's palace. Pulling on a gondolier's cloak and hood, he sets off on his adventure. The scene is set and the evening still, as the Duke looks up to Delacqua's balcony and sings a serenade. Inside the Delacqua house Barbara and Annina are making their final preparations, putting on the domino masks that will disguise them, as they await the sound of the gondolier's song that is to be the agreed signal. Below, Ciboletta brings Pappacoda a carnival costume.\n\tFinally the voice of Caramello is heard from the gondola singing the gondolier's song. Delacqua helps into the gondola the masked figure he believes to be his wife and he bids her farewell as the Duke looks on with keen anticipation. A group of sailors appear and, with Enrico at their head, they sing a serenade to Delacqua for his birthday the following day. While Delacqua is on the balcony thanking the singers, Barbara slips out to join Enrico. The birthday serenade merges with the sound of Caramello's gondola song as night falls on Venice and the disguised Caramello glides away with his masked sweetheart Annina, neither knowing the true identity of the other.\n\tAct 2\n\tWatching from a room in his palace, the Duke is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the gondola in which Caramello is due to bring Barbara, as Agricola, Constantia and the other senators' wives arrive in their carnival costumes, ignoring their husbands' fears for their moral safety. Finally the gondola is seen approaching, and the Duke ushers his guests into the ballroom while he prepares to greet his special lady guest. When Caramello and Annina arrive and masks are removed, Caramello is dismayed to discover who it is he has brought for the Duke's pleasure, but Annina fancies making the most of the opportunity with the Duke that fate has given her.\n\tCaramello does his best to warn the Duke off Annina. \"Don't trust her. She scratches and bites!\" he warns. Finally Annina and the Duke are left alone, and the disguised Annina is shocked and thrown on the defensive when the Duke rhapsodises over the receptive response that his advances to Barbara had previously aroused. As the orchestra in the ballroom strikes up a waltz, the Duke takes the reluctant Annina into his arms.\n\tCaramello finds an excuse to interrupt the amorous scene, and Annina persuades the Duke to take her into the ballroom. While they are away, Caramello opens the doors to the Duke's apartments, and a crowd enters, including Pappacoda, prominent in a faded, shabby senator's costume with false, misshapen nose and spectacles and with his pockets stuffed with sausages, meat and pastries. Pappacoda has brought with him all his tradesmen friends, to whom he has distributed invitations given to him by Caramello. They are wide-eyed at the scale of the Duke's hospitality and, having introduced his friends to Caramello, Pappacoda invites them to help themselves.\n\tAs the Duke seeks somewhere to be alone with Annina, a group of senators and their wives detain him. Among them are Senator Delacqua and his supposed wife, and the Duke is taken aback at being introduced to a second Barbara. However, Annina identifies this \"wife\" for the Duke as the masked Ciboletta. The Duke goes along with Ciboletta's pretence, as he recalls the serenade he had sung to Barbara at previous carnival times. Delacqua pushes the supposed Barbara forward to put his own case for the position of the Duke's steward, but Ciboletta instead asks for a place for Pappacoda as the Duke's personal cook, and the Duke is only too ready to oblige her. Delacqua departs to join Barbara in Murano, leaving the Duke to take supper with Annina and Ciboletta. Caramello has sent away the servants, and he and Pappacoda wait on the trio personally in order to keep their eyes open for any unwelcome developments.\n\tAs the Duke courts the two ladies, Caramello and Pappacoda repeatedly interrupt. The cook gives a timely discourse on his culinary arts before the senators' wives arrive seeking the Duke's attention. By now midnight is approaching - the time when the Duke must go to lead the revels in the Piazza San Marco. When the bells of St. Mark's Basilica sound out, Annina joins in the revelry, and all go off in masks to enjoy themselves.\n\tAct 3\n\tIn the Piazza, before the moonlit cathedral, the revellers are celebrating, but Caramello stands alone, reflecting upon Annina's flirtation with the Duke and lamenting the fickleness of women. Ciboletta, meanwhile, is looking for Pappacoda to tell him of his appointment as the Duke's personal cook, a piece of news that dispels Pappacoda's wrath at Ciboletta's adventures with the Duke. Now they can marry. When Pappacoda goes to pay his respects to the Duke, Ciboletta reveals to the Duke that the young lady on whom he had been lavishing his attention was not Barbara but Caramello's sweetheart Annina. When the Duke finally catches up with Annina, he finds her telling the senators' wives all about her escapade with him. Fanfares announce the start of the grand Carnival procession, in which all sections of Venetian life are represented and, when it is over, the pigeons of St. Mark's flutter down into the square.\n\tDelacqua has returned, distressed by the discovery that Barbara is not in Murano and, when she appears with Enrico, the young man reassures Delacqua with a story of how he has rescued his aunt Barbara from an impostor gondolier. The Duke is decidedly less interested in Barbara when he discovers that she has a nephew as big as Enrico, and he rewards Caramello for delivering him from a potentially awkward situation by making him his steward. Caramello and Annina can therefore join Pappacoda and Ciboletta in marrying, and the revelries are set fair to go on long into the night."},{"opera_title":"Apollo et Hyacinthus","composer":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","synopsis":"King Oebalus of Lacedaemonia and his son, Hyacinthus are preparing a sacrifice to Apollo when their altar is struck by a bolt of lightning.

The pirates' maid of all work, Ruth, appears and reveals that, as Frederic's nursemaid long ago, she had made a mistake \"through being hard of hearing\": she had misheard Frederic's father's instructions and apprenticed him to a pirate, instead of to a ship's pilot (\"When Frederic was a little lad\").\nLeft alone, Frederic, who is to lead the group, pauses to reflect on his opportunity to atone for a life of piracy (\"Now for the pirate's lair\"), at which point he encounters Ruth and the Pirate King. It has occurred to them that his apprenticeship was worded so as to bind him to them until his twenty-first birthday - and, because that birthday happens to be on 29 February (in a leap year), it means that technically only five birthdays have passed (\"When you had left our pirate fold\"), and he will not reach his twenty-first birthday until he is in his eighties. Frederic is convinced by this logic that he must rejoin the pirates, and thus he sees it as his duty to inform the Pirate King of the Major-General's deception. The outraged outlaw declares that their \"revenge will be swift and terrible\" (\"Away, away, my heart's on fire\").\nFrederic meets Mabel (\"All is prepared\"), and she pleads with him to stay (\"Stay Frederic, stay\"), but he explains that he must fulfil his duty to the pirates until his 21st birthday in 1940. He promises to return then and claim her. They agree to be faithful to each other until then, though to Mabel \"It seems so long\" (\"Oh here is love and here is truth\"), and Frederic departs. Mabel steels herself (\"No, I'll be brave\") and tells the police that they must go alone to face the pirates. They muse that an outlaw might be just like any other man, and it is a shame to deprive him of \"that liberty which is so dear to all\" (\"When a felon's not engaged in his employment\"). The police hide on hearing the approach of the pirates (\"A rollicking band of pirates we\"), who have stolen onto the grounds, meaning to avenge themselves for the Major-General's lie (\"With cat-like tread\").\nThe police and the pirates prepare for the fight (\"Hush, hush! not a word\"). Just then, the Major-General appears, sleepless with guilt, and the pirates also hide, while General Stanley listens to the soothing sighing of the breeze (\"Sighing softly to the river\"). The girls come looking for him (\"Now what is this and what is that\"). The pirates leap to the attack, and the police rush to the defence; but the police are easily defeated, and the Pirate King urges the captured Major-General to prepare for death. The Sergeant plays his trump card, demanding that the pirates yield \"in Queen Victoria's name\"; the pirates, overcome with loyalty to their Queen, do so. Ruth appears and reveals that the orphan pirates are in fact \"all noblemen who have gone wrong\". The Major-General is impressed by this and all is forgiven. Frederic and Mabel are reunited, and the Major-General is happy to marry his daughters to the noble pirates after all."},{"opera_title":"Amico Fritz","composer":"Pietro Mascagni","synopsis":"Time: indefinite; sometime in the 19th centuryPlace: indefinite; probably somewhere in Alsace\n Act 1\nThe dining room of Fritz Kobus' house\nFritz Kobus, a wealthy landowner is in discussion with his friend David, the local rabbi.

Pooh-Bah informs Nanki-Poo that Yum-Yum is scheduled to marry Ko-Ko on that very day (\"Young man, despair\").\nThe Mikado and Katisha arrive in Titipu with little notice, but accompanied by a large procession (\"A more humane Mikado\"). Ko-Ko assumes that he has come to see whether an execution has been carried out. Aided by Pitti-Sing and Pooh-Bah, he gives a graphic description of the supposed execution (\"The criminal cried\") and hands the Mikado the certificate of death-signed and sworn to by Pooh-Bah as coroner and noting, slyly, that most of the town's important officers (that is, Pooh-Bah) were present at the \"ceremony\". However, the Mikado has come about an entirely different matter-he is searching for his son. When they hear that the Mikado's son \"goes by the name of Nanki-Poo\", the three panic, and Ko-Ko says that Nanki-Poo \"has gone abroad\". Meanwhile, Katisha is reading the death certificate and notes with horror that the person \"executed\" was Nanki-Poo. The Mikado, though expressing understanding and sympathy (\"See How the Fates\"), discusses with Katisha the statutory punishment \"for compassing the death of the heir apparent\" to the Imperial throne-something lingering, \"with boiling oil... or melted lead\". With the three conspirators facing painful execution, Ko-Ko pleads with Nanki-Poo to return. Nanki-Poo fears that Katisha will order his execution if she finds he is alive, but notes that if Ko-Ko could persuade Katisha to marry him, then Nanki-Poo could safely \"come to life again\" as Katisha would have no claim on him (\"The flowers that bloom in the spring\"). Though Katisha is \"something appalling\", Ko-Ko has no choice: it is marriage to Katisha, or a painful death for all three.\nKo-Ko discovers Katisha mourning her loss (\"Alone, and yet alive\") and throws himself on her mercy. He begs for her hand in marriage, saying that he has long harboured a passion for her. Katisha initially rebuffs him, but is soon moved by his pleadings (\"Tit-willow\"). She agrees (\"There is beauty in the bellow of the blast\") and, once the ceremony is performed (by Pooh-Bah, the Registrar), begs mercy for him and his \"accomplices\" from the Mikado. Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum then re-appear, sparking Katisha's fury. The Mikado is astonished that Nanki-Poo is alive, when the account of his execution had been given with such \"affecting particulars\". Ko-Ko explains that when a royal command for an execution is given, the victim is, legally speaking, as good as dead, \"and if he is dead, why not say so?\" The Mikado deems that \"Nothing could possibly be more satisfactory\", and so Titipu celebrates (\"For he's gone and married Yum-Yum\")."},{"opera_title":"H.M.S. Pinafore","composer":"Arthur Sullivan","synopsis":"Act I\nThe British warship H.M.S. Pinafore is at anchor off Portsmouth. The sailors are on the quarterdeck, proudly \"cleaning brasswork, splicing rope, etc.\"\nLittle Buttercup, a Portsmouth \"bumboat woman\" (dockside vendor) - who is the \"rosiest, roundest, and reddest beauty in all Spithead\" - comes on board to sell her wares to the crew. She hints that she may be hiding a dark secret under her \"gay and frivolous exterior\". Ralph Rackstraw, \"the smartest lad in all the fleet\", enters, declaring his love for the Captain's daughter, Josephine. His fellow sailors (excepting Dick Deadeye, the grim and ugly realist of the crew) offer their sympathies, but they can give Ralph little hope that his love will ever be returned.\nSir Joseph enters and complains that Josephine has not yet agreed to marry him. The Captain speculates that she is probably dazzled by his \"exalted rank\" and that if Sir Joseph can persuade her that \"love levels all ranks\", she will accept his proposal. They withdraw, and Josephine enters, still feeling guilty about her planned elopement with Ralph and fearful of giving up a life of luxury. When Sir Joseph makes the argument that \"love levels all ranks\", a delighted Josephine says that she \"will hesitate no longer\". The Captain and Sir Joseph rejoice, but Josephine is now more determined than ever to marry Ralph.\nDick Deadeye intercepts the Captain and tells him of the lovers' plans to elope. The Captain confronts Ralph and Josephine as they try to leave the ship. The pair declare their love, justifying their actions because \"He is an Englishman!\" The furious Captain is unmoved and blurts out, \"Why, damme, it's too bad!\" Sir Joseph and his relatives, who have overheard this oath, are shocked to hear swearing on board a ship, and Sir Joseph orders the Captain confined to his cabin.\nWhen Sir Joseph asks what had provoked the usually polite officer's outburst, Ralph replies that it was his declaration of love for Josephine. Furious in his turn at this revelation, and ignoring Josephine's plea to spare Ralph, Sir Joseph has the sailor \"loaded with chains\" and taken to the ship's dungeon. Little Buttercup now comes forward to reveal her long-held secret. Many years ago, when she \"practised baby-farming\", she had cared for two babies, one \"of low condition\", the other \"a regular patrician\". She confesses that she \"mixed those children up\u00a0.... The wellborn babe was Ralph; your Captain was the other.\"\nSir Joseph now realises that Ralph should have been the Captain, and the Captain should have been Ralph. He summons both, and they emerge wearing one another's uniforms: Ralph as Captain, in command of the Pinafore, and Corcoran as a common sailor. Sir Joseph's marriage with Josephine is now \"out of the question\" in his eyes: \"love levels all ranks\u00a0... to a considerable extent, but it does not level them as much as that.\" He hands her to Captain Rackstraw. The former Captain's now-humble social rank leaves him free to marry Buttercup. Sir Joseph settles for his cousin Hebe, and all ends in general rejoicing."},{"opera_title":"Siegfried","composer":"Richard Wagner","synopsis":"ACT I\nMime's forge in the forest\nMime tries in vain to forge a sword strong enough for Siegfried to kill the dragon Fafner. Siegfried returns from the forest with a bear with which he terrifies Mime. He easily breaks the latest sword on the anvil. Mime reproaches him with ingratitude, reminding him that he has brought him up from childhood. Refusing to believe that Mime is his father, Siegfried manages to extract from him the information that his mother, Sieglinde, had died giving birth to him, leaving the fragments of his father's sword, Nothung. Siegfried demands that Mime reforge this sword and storms out, hoping he may soon be free of the dwarf.\nMime knows he cannot forge the sword, but when the Wanderer (Wotan) appears and offers to answer any three questions on pain of forfeiting his head, Mime asks him only useless questions (about the races of dwarf, giants and gods). When the Wanderer demands a reciprocal question test, Mime is able to answer the first two questions but fails on the third: who will reforge Nothung? The Wanderer tells Mime that his head is forfeit, but he leaves it to be claimed by one who knows no fear.\nMime realises that this is one lesson he has failed to teach Siegfried and tries vainly to make up this omission, but Siegfried is unmoved, even by the mention of the fearsome dragon. Mime has to admit that his skill is unequal to the task of forging Nothung and Siegfried takes to the task himself, breaking all the rules of smithing, but succeeding, while Mime brews a potion he plans to administer to Siegfried when he has killed Fafner, so that he can kill him and seize the ring.\nACT II\nDeep in the forest, near the entrance to Fafner's cave\nAlberich waits near the cave, hoping that someone will kill the dragon and give him the chance to take possession once more of the ring. The Wanderer appears and, to Alberich's surprise, professes no interest in the ring, but warns him that Mime is bringing Siegfried to kill the dragon. The Wanderer summons Fafner, who rejects Alberich's offer to protect him from Siegfried in exchange for the ring. \u2028Mime brings Siegfried to the spot, promising that here he will learn fear. Siegfried wonders about his mother and listens to the murmurs of the forest, in particular a bird, whose warbling he tries to imitate on a roughly improvised reed pipe. He gives up and blows a call on his hunting horn, which wakens Fafner. Siegfried kills the dragon; when he pulls out his sword, his hand is splashed with blood. As he sucks it clean, he finds himself able to understand the woodbird, which tells him to take the ring and Tarnhelm from the hoard.\nMime and Alberich meet and quarrel, watching with horror as Siegfried emerges with the ring and Tarnhelm. The woodbird warns Siegfried of Mime's intended treachery and when Mime offers him the drugged drink, he is able to understand Mime's thoughts and strikes him dead. The woodbird tells Siegfried of a bride awaiting him on a rock surrounded by fire and he sets off, following the bird.\nACT III\nA wild spot at the foot of a mountain\nThe Wanderer summons the sleeping Erda, once more seeking the benefit of her wisdom, but she answers that she now knows nothing, suggesting first that he ask the Norns (fates) and then Br\u00fcnnhilde. She is horrifed to learn about Br\u00fcnnhilde's punishment. The Wanderer then says that he has no need of her advice as he has decided to accept gladly the end of his power; he will leave the world to Siegfried, and Br\u00fcnnhilde will perform the redeeming deed.\nBut when Siegfried appears, he is impatient to find yet another old man standing in his path. His youthful brashness arouses the Wanderer's anger and as Siegfried tries to go past, he interposes his spear, pointing out that the sword Siegfried carries has already been shattered by it. Believing that he has found his father's enemy, Siegfried breaks the spear with his sword.\nThe Wanderer withdraws, no longer able to oppose Siegfried, who climbs the mountain and passes through the ring of flame which surrounds Br\u00fcnnhilde. After some hesitation he kisses her awake and she greets him ecstatically by name. At first, however, she shrinks from his embrace, reluctant to lose her divine powers, but eventually responds to his passion and they triumphantly proclaim their love."},{"opera_title":"Les Hugenots","composer":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","synopsis":"The story culminates in the historical St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572 in which thousands of French Huguenots (Protestants) were slaughtered by Catholics in an effort to rid France of Protestant influence. Although the massacre was a historical event, the rest of the action, which primarily concerns the love between the Catholic Valentine and the Protestant Raoul, is wholly a creation of Scribe.\n Act 1\nThe chateau of the Count\nA short orchestral prelude, featuring the Lutheran chorale Ein feste Burg, replaces the extended overture Meyerbeer originally intended for the opera. The Catholic Count of Nevers is entertaining his fellow noblemen. They await the arrival of Raoul, and are surprised to hear that this emissary of the Court is a Huguenot. After a drinking song at Raoul's entry, the newcomer is prevailed upon to give a tale of love. Raoul tells of an unknown beauty he has rescued and fallen in love with. (With a daring and unusual stroke of orchestration, Meyerbeer accompanies this aria with a solo viola d'amore). Raoul's Protestant servant Marcel is shocked to see his master in such wicked company and sings a hearty Protestant prayer (to the tune of 'Ein fester Burg'). He then sings a Huguenot battle song from the siege of La Rochelle, Pif, paf.\nThe arrival of a mysterious lady stranger to speak to Nevers (off stage) interrupts the proceedings. Raoul recognises her as his mysterious beauty. In fact she is Nevers' intended bride, Valentine (daughter of St. Bris), instructed by the Queen to break off her engagement. The page Urbain enters with a secret message for Raoul, daring him to come blindfolded to a secret rendezvous.\n Act 2\nThe chateau and gardens of Chenonceaux\nQueen Marguerite looks into a mirror held by her enamoured page Urbain, and sings the virtuoso pastorale, O beau pays de la Touraine. Valentine enters and reports that Nevers has agreed to break the engagement. Marguerite's entourage of ladies enter dressed for bathing. This leads to a ballet. Raoul enters blindfolded and the ladies tease him. With his sight restored, the Queen orders Raoul to marry Valentine to cement relations between the Protestant and Catholic factions. In a complex final ensemble, while a chorus of nobles swears friendship, Raoul, who believes Valentine is the mistress of Nevers, refuses to comply with the Queen's command. The nobles then swear revenge, and Marcel reproaches Raoul for mixing with Catholics.\n Act 3\nParis, the 'Pr\u00e9 aux clercs' on the left bank of the Seine, at sunset\nThe act opens with extensive scene setting of citizens, soldiers, church-goers and gypsies. Valentine has just married Nevers, but remains in the chapel to pray. Marcel delivers a challenge from Raoul. Saint-Bris decides to attack Raoul, but is overheard by Valentine. A watchman declares curfew (the scene anticipating a similar one in Wagner's Die Meistersinger). Valentine, in disguise, tells Marcel of the plot against Raoul. The duel is interrupted by rival factions of Protestant and Catholic students, and only the arrival of the Queen stems the chaos. Raoul realises that Valentine has saved him and that his suspicions of her were unfounded. However, now she is wedded to his enemy. Nevers leads her away in a splendid procession.\n Act 4\nA room in Nevers' Parisian town-house\nValentine, alone, is surprised by Raoul who wishes to have one last meeting with her. The sound of approaching people leads Raoul to hide behind a curtain, where he hears the Catholic nobles, accompanied by three monks, who bless their swords, pledge to murder the Huguenots. Only Nevers does not join in the oath. This scene is generally judged the most gripping in the opera, and is accompanied by some of its most dramatic music. When the nobles have departed, Raoul is torn between warning his fellows and staying with Valentine, but finally duty triumphs over love. Valentine faints as Raoul makes his escape.\n Act 5\nScene 1: A ballroom\nThe Protestants are celebrating the marriage of the Queen to Henry of Navarre. The tolling of a bell interrupts the proceeding, as does the entrance of Raoul, who informs the assembly that the second stroke was the signal for the Catholic massacre of the Huguenots.\n(A performance tradition existed in some centres of ending the opera with Scene 1 and its suggestion of the massacre.)\nScene 2: A cemetery: in the background, a ruined Protestant church\nNevers dies protecting Marcel, who is wounded; Valentine agrees to become a Protestant to marry Raoul and Marcel carries out the nuptials. A 'chorus of murderers' shoots all three, after they express their vision of heaven, 'with six harps'. They are finally murdered by St. Bris and his men, he realising only too late that he has killed his own daughter. (Cf. the closing scene of Fromental Hal\u00e9vy's opera, La Juive, libretto also by Scribe, produced a year earlier than Les Huguenots). The entrance of the Queen, and the chorus of soldiers singing 'God wants blood!', brings the opera to a close."},{"opera_title":"I due Foscari","composer":"Giuseppe Verdi","synopsis":"Place: VeniceTime: 1457\n Act 1\nScene 1: Outside the Council Chamber of the Doge's Palace\nMembers of the Council of Ten are waiting to enter the Council Chamber to try the case of Jacopo Foscari, the son of the Doge, who has been accused of murder. Upon the arrival of Loredano (Jacopo's sworn enemy) and his friend Barbarigo, they announce that the Doge has already entered the Chamber. They all enter the Chamber.\nHaving recently returned from exile, Jacopo is brought from the prison and expresses his love at seeing Venice again: Dal pi\u00f9 remoto esilio (\"From the most distant place of exile\"). When summoned to enter the Chamber and told that he can expect the Council to be merciful, Jacopo explodes in rage: Odio solo ed odio atroce (\"Only hatred, cruel hatred, is locked within their breasts\"). He enters the Chamber.\nScene 2: A hall in the palace\nLucrezia Contarini, Jacopo's wife, learns from her ladies in waiting that the trial is proceeding in the Council Chamber. She quickly demands to see the Doge, Jacopo's father, but is told that she should pray for Jacopo's freedom. Angrily, she implores heaven to be merciful: Tu al cui sguardi onni possente (\"Thou beneath whose almighty glance all men rejoice or weep\"). Her friend Pisana enters in tears; she relays the news that Jacopo has been sentenced to further exile and this provokes another furious outburst from Lucrezia: La clemenza! s'aggiunge lo scherno! (\"Their mercy? Now they add insult!\"). Pisana and the ladies beg her to trust in the mercy of God.\nScene 3: Outside the Council Chamber\nThe Council of Ten leaves the Chamber proclaiming that the evidence was clearly sufficient to convict Jacopo and that their actions will be seen as just and fair.\nScene 4: The Doge's private room\nThe Doge, Francesco Foscari, enters and wearily sits down. He expresses anguish at what has happened to his son but, as his father, feels there is nothing he can do to save him: O vecchio cor che batte (\"Oh ancient heart that beats in my breast...\"). In tears, Lucreza comes in and, when she tries to decry the actions of the Council, Francesco reminds her of his position as upholder of the law of Venice. Angrily, she denounces the law as being filled only with hatred and vengeance and demands that he return her husband to her: Tu pur lo sai che giudice (\"You know it all too well\"). The scene ends with the Doge lamenting the limits of his power and the conflicts between being both ruler and father, while Lucrezia continues to demand his help. The sight of his tears gives her some hope.\n Act 2\nScene 1: The state prison\nJacopo is alone in prison and laments his fate. He imagines that he is being attacked by Carmagnola, a famous condottiere (soldier) who was executed in Venice (Non maledirmi o prode (\"Mighty warrior, do not curse me\"), and he faints. Still delirious, he finds Lucrezia is with him; she tells him of the Council's decision and the punishment of further exile. However, she tries to keep some hope alive and promises to join him in exile if need be.\nThe Doge arrives and declares that in spite of the fact that he was forced to act severely, he loves his son. Jacopo is comforted - Nel tuo paterno amplesso (\"In a father's embrace my sorrow is stilled\") - but is further disturbed by the Doge's claim that his duty must override his love of his son.\nLoredano arrives to announce the official verdict and to prepare Jacopo for his departure. He is contemptuous of the pleas of the Foscari and orders his men to remove Jacopo from his cell. In a final trio, Jacopo, the Doge, and Lucrezia express their conflicting emotions and, as Jacopo is taken away, father and daughter-in-law leave together.\nScene 2: The Council Chamber\nLoredano is adamant: there shall be no mercy and Lucrezia and her children will not be allowed to accompany Jacopo on his banishment. The Doge laments his inability to help, acting, as he must, in the role of Doge before that of father. Lucrezia enters with her two children. Jacopo embraces them while Lucrezia pleads with the councilors to no avail. Jacopo is taken away.\n Act 3\nScene 1: The Piazetta of San Marco\nWhile the people who have gathered express their joy at being together, Loredano and Barbarigo wait for the galley that will take Jacopo away to exile. He is led out, followed by his wife and Pisana, and expresses his feelings for Lucrezia: All'infelice veglio (\"Unhappy woman, unhappy through me alone\"). Together, in a huge choral number, Jacopo, Lucrezia, Pisano, Barbarigo, Loredano, and the people of Venice each express their feelings. Jacopo begins: O padre, figli, sposa (\"Father, children, wife, I bid you a last farewell\"), and the scene ends with Jacopo escorted onto the galley while Lucrezia faints in Pisana's arms.\nScene 2: The Doge's Palace\nThe grief stricken Doge expresses his feelings - Egli ore parte! (\"Now he is going!\") - and pictures himself alone in his old age. Barbarigo brings him proof that his son was in fact innocent, while Lucrezia comes in to announce Jacopo's death: Pi\u00f9 non vive... l'innocente \/ (\"He is no more... the innocent\"). As she leaves, a servant announces that the Council of Ten wish to meet with the Doge.\nThe Council, through its spokesman Loredano, announces that it has decided that Francesco, due to age, should give up his position as Doge. Angrily, he denounces their decision: Questa dunque \u00e8 l'iniqua mercede (\"This then is the unjust reward...\"). He asks for his daughter-in-law to be brought in and gradually lays down the trappings of his office. When Lucrezia enters and addresses him with the familiar title \"Prince\", he declares \"Prince! That I was; now I am no longer.\" Just then, the bell of San Marco is heard announcing that a successor has been chosen. As it tolls a second time, Francesco recognizes that the end has come: Quel bronzo feral (\"What fatal knell\"). As the bell tolls again, he dies; Loredano notes that \"I am paid.\""},{"opera_title":"Im Weissen Rossl","composer":"Ralph Benatzky","synopsis":"It is summertime at the Wolfgangsee.

His wife Lina, her father Stankar, and her cousins Dorotea and Federico are waiting for him. In addition, there is Raffaele who, unknown to all, is Lina 's lover. Stiffelio arrives and recounts how the castle's boatman has told him the strange story of having seen a man and a woman escaping from a castle window and, as they did so, dropping a packet of letters, which Stiffelio now holds. Refusing to learn by opening the package who was involved, he throws the letters into the fire, much to the relief of Lina and Raffaele. Secretly, Raffaele communicates to Lina that he will leave instructions as where they may next meet inside a locked volume in the library.\nAfter he has been greeted by friends, Lina and Stiffelio are left alone (Non ha per me un acento - \"She has no word for me, not a glance\").

There is an attempt at conciliation whereby the priest takes Stankar's hand and then Raffaelo's, joining them together. However, Stankar reveals that Stiffelio has touched the hand of the man who betrayed him! Not quite understanding at first, Stiffelio demands that the mystery be solved. As Lina returns demanding her husband's forgiveness, Stiffelio begins to comprehend the situation (Ah, no! E impossibile - \"It cannot be! Tell me at least that it is a lie\"). Demanding an explanation, he challenges Raffaelo to fight but, as he is about to strike the younger man, Jorg arrives to summon the priest to the church from which the sound of the waiting congregation can be heard.

Stiffelio lays out the reason that their marriage can be annulled (Opposto \u00e8 il calle che in avvenire - \"Opposite are the paths that in future our lives will follow\"). Lina's reaction, when presented with the divorce decree, is to swear an on-going love for her husband (\"I will die for love of you\"). Appealing to Stiffelio more as a priest than as a husband, Lina confesses that she has always loved him and she still does.

The following is a synopsis for the typical two act presentation of the work that is most often used for modern performances.\n\tAct 1\n\tShepherds and nymphs enjoy \"the pleasure of the plains\". Galatea, a semi-divine nymph, is in love with the shepherd Acis, and tries to hush the birds that ignite her passion for him (\"Hush, ye pretty warbling quire!\") Acis's close friend, the shepherd Damon, provides counsel to the lovers as they pursue each other. He sings a beautiful siciliana-style serenade, \"Love in her eyes sits playing\", upon their first meeting. The act closes with a duet by the young lovers, \"Happy we\", which is echoed by a chorus (not in the Cannons original).\n\tAct 2\n\tThe opera shifts from its pastoral and sensual mood into an elegiac quality as the chorus warns Acis and Galatea about the arrival of a monstrous giant, Polyphemus, singing \"no joy shall last\". The fugal minor-key of the chorus's music along with the percussive lines in the lower instruments, indicating the heavy footsteps of the giant, provides an effective dramatic transition into the more serious nature of the second act. Polyphemus enters singing of his jealous love for Galatea, \"I rage, I melt, I burn\", which is in a part-comic furioso accompanied recitative. This is followed by his aria \"O ruddier than the cherry\" which is written in counterpoint to a sopranino recorder. Polyphemus threatens force but is somewhat soothed by the impartial shepherd, Coridon (\"Would you gain the tender creature\"). Meanwhile, Acis ignores Damon's warning of the fleeting existence of love's delight (\"Consider, fond shepherd\") and responds hostilely with the determination to resist (\"Love sounds th' alarm\"). Acis and Galatea promise eternal fidelity to each other in what begins as a duet (\"The flocks shall leave the mountains\") but ultimately turns into a trio when Polyphemus intrudes and brutally murders Acis in a rage. Galatea, along with the chorus, mourns the loss of her love (\"Must I my Acis still bemoan\"). The chorus reminds her of her deity and that with her divine powers she can transform Acis's corpse into a beautiful fountain. The opera closes with Galatea's larghetto air, \"Heart, the seat of soft delight\", where she exerts her powers to enact the transformation, ending with the chorus celebrating Acis's immortilization."},{"opera_title":"Il Corsaro","composer":"Giuseppe Verdi","synopsis":"Place: A Greek island in the Aegean and the Turkish city of Corone.Time: The early 1800s\n Act 1\nThe Greek Island\nScene 1: Corrado's ship\nThe island is controlled by the corsairs, or pirates. A chorus introduces Corrado, the chief corsair, who is in exile. He laments his present condition: Tutto parea sorridere \/ \"The world seemed to smile upon my early life\". But he receives a letter containing military intelligence about the Turkish Pasha, Seid. It convinces him to set sail with his comrades, and he immediately starts rallying the troops: S\u00ec, di Corsari il fulmine \/ \"Yes, the lightning blow of the Corsairs shall I myself strike\".\nScene 2: Medora's home\nMedora is alone, and anxious for Corrado's return. She picks up her harp and sings a beautiful, but vaguely sinister aria; some sixth sense seems to be telling her that things are bound to turn out badly: Non so le tetre immagini \/ \"Dark forebodings I cannot banish from my thoughts\". When Corrado finally arrives, the two sing a duet that captures both the serenity of their love and the uncertainty of their future. Medora pleads with Corrado not to leave, but finally he departs to confront the Pasha.\n Act 2\nCorone\nScene 1: The harem\nThe slave girls in Pasha Seid's harem are looking after Gulnara, the Pasha's favorite. However, Gulnara is unhappy about the Pasha's attentions. She chafes at life in the harem, and longs for freedom and true love: Vola talor dal carcere \/ \"At times my thought flies free from its prison\". A eunuch brings Gulnara an invitation to a celebratory banquet anticipating the Pasha's victory in the impending sea battle with the corsairs. She expresses a hope of something better awaiting her in life: Ah conforto \u00e8 sol la speme \/ \"Ah, comfort lies only in hope for this lost soul\" and the ladies of the harem tell her that \"you are everyone's hope\".\nScene 2: The banquet\nSeid and his men express their feelings that Allah will protect them: Salve, Allah! tutta quanta \/ \"Hail Allah! All the earth resounds with his mighty name\". A slave asks the Pasha if a Dervish who has apparently escaped from the corsairs might be admitted. Seid grants an audience and questions him. Suddenly everyone notices flames at sea: the Pasha's fleet is burning. As the Dervish whips off his disguise and reveals himself to be Corrado, his corsairs invade the banquet, and a battle takes place. At first, it seems that Corrado and his men will win, but he makes a fatal mistake. Seeing that the harem is burning, Corrado decides to rescue Gulnara and the other women. This gives the Pasha and his men time to regroup. They take Corrado prisoner and Seid confronts him - Audace cotannto, mostrarti pur sai? \/ \"Yet so bold do you stand before me\" - as he condemns Corrado to a grisly death, in spite of pleas from Gulnara and the harem to spare him for saving their lives.\n Act 3\nScene 1: Seid's quarters\nSeid is enjoying his victory, but he is not entirely satisfied: Cento leggiadre vergini \/ \"A hundred lissom virgins asked love of me\" he says, but \"my heart beats only for Gulnara\". He is afraid she has fallen for the dashing Corrado. Sending for her, he proclaims his basic credo of revenge: S'avvincina il tuo momento \/ \"Your moment approaches, dread thirst for vengeance\". When she enters, he challenges her and she tells him that he is right; he threatens Gulnara, but she defies him and the Pasha storms out of the room.\nScene 2: The prison\nCorrado is in prison and assumes that he is doomed: Eccomi prigionero! \/ \"Here am I a prisoner\". Having bribed a guard to let her into his cell, Gulnara vows to help him, handing him a knife to kill Seid. Corrado rejects her offer, citing his honor as a combatant. He also senses her deep feelings for him, and tells her that he is in love with Medora. Gulnara leaves, saying that she will kill Seid. In a brief interlude, the stormy music, which opened the Prelude, is heard again; this time, it accompanies a murder. On her return Gulnara reports that she takes all the blame for killing the Pasha: Sul capo mio discenta, fierro Iddio \/ \"Upon my head, grim God, let your dread lightning fall\". With their enemy gone, she and Corrado resolve to escape together to the corsairs' island.\nScene 3: The Greek island\nNear death after taking poison, Medora is convinced and she will never see Corrado again. The ship carrying Gulnara and Corrado appears in the distance and, when they arrive, Corrado and Medora throw themselves into each other's arms. In a trio with each character expressing his\/her feelings, Corrado begins by explaining how he and Gulnara became free: Per me infelice vedi costei \/ \"Unhappy for my sake you see this woman; she risked her life to save mine\". However, their joy does not last for long, for Medora dies. With his men trying to stop him, Corrado leaps from a cliff to his death as the opera ends."},{"opera_title":"Un Giorno di regno","composer":"Giuseppe Verdi","synopsis":"Time: 1733Place: Baron Kelbar's castle near Brest, France\n Act 1\nScene 1: A gallery in the home of Baron Kelbar \nBelfiore, impersonating the Polish king Stanislaus, is a guest at the home of Baron Kelbar and he comments to himself on his change of fortune: Compagnoni di Parigi...Verr\u00e0\u00a0 purtroppo il giorno \/ \"If only my old comrades in Paris could see me now, the most dissolute officer in the regiment turned philosopher king.\"  The Baron has recently arranged a political alliance by betrothing his daughter, Giulietta, to La Rocca, the Brittany Treasurer, but Giulietta prefers La Rocca's nephew, Edoardo. Another undesired marriage involves the Baron's niece, the Marchesa del Poggio, a young widow who is in love with Belfiore. She has become engaged to the Count of Ivrea because Belfiore has been unable to commit himself to marrying her, in spite of the fact that he does love her.\nKnowing of the Marchesa's imminent arrival and concerned that she might reveal his false identity as the King, Belfiore writes to Stanislaw and asks to be released from his commitment. Edoardo reveals his predicament to the \"King\" and begs to be taken to Poland with him in order to forget about the woman he loves. In addition, when the Marchesa arrives and, upon being introduced to Belfiore as \"the King\", she pretends not to recognize him. Likewise, he pretends not to recognize her, but she is determined to test him by proclaiming her love for the Count: Grave a core innamorato...Se dee cader la vedova \/ \" \".\nScene 2: the Garden of Kelbar's castle\nGiulietta is alone with her attendants and expresses unhappioness in having to marry an old man: 'Non san quant'io nel petto...Non vo' quel vecchio \/ \" \". When the Count and La Rocca arrive, followed in succession by Belfiore and Edoardo and then the Marchesa (who was planning to help the lovers), Belfiore draws the Count and La Rocca away on the pretext of discussing state business, leaving the young lovers alone with the Marchesa.\nScene 3: the gallery of Kelbar's castle\nMaintaining his role as the King, Belfiore makes the Treasurer an offer of advancement which would include marriage to a rich widow. By accepting, he agrees not to marry Giulietta. When the treasurer tells the Baron that he refuses to marry his daughter, the Baron is affronted and challenges him to a duel. To add to the confusion all around, the Marchesa immediately proposes that Giulietta and Edoardo be married immediately. However, the false King returns and proposes that he will decide on a solution that will satisfy everyone.\n Act 2\nScene 1: the gallery of Kelbar's castle\nFollowing the \"King's\" pronouncement, the servants are mystified and they sing a carefree chorus which leads to Edoardo seeking their support and announcing his hope of still be able to marry Giulietta: Pietoso al lungo pianto...Deh lasciate a un alma amante \/ \" \".\nBelfiore, the Treasurer, and Giulietta enter discussing the reasons for the Baron's opposition to his daughter's marriage to Eduardo. Giulietta explains that the young man's poverty is the main objection and so Belfiore immediately rules that the Treasurer must give up one of his castles and give over a sum of money to the young man, and then all will be well. The latter is somewhat reluctant to disobey his sovereign, but seeks a way out of his duel with the Baron.\nScene 2: a veranda overlooking the castle gardens\nBelfiore and the Marchesa meet on the veranda, the former still unable to reveal who he really is. This incenses the lady, who boldly states that it is her intention to marry the Count of Ivrea. However, she cannot understand why Belfiore is taking so long to reveal himself and still hopes for his change of heart: (andante) Si mostri a chi l'adora... \/ \" \". When Count Ivrea is announced, she takes a defiant stand (cabaletta): Si, scordar sapr\u00f2 l'infido \/ \" \". Since Eduardo has pledged to join the \"King\" when he goes to Poland, Giulietta is determined to get the King to rescind the commitment. The Count enters and the Marchesa once again states that she will marry the Count. However, Belfiore immediately forbids the marriage for 'reasons of state' and announces that he and the Count must leave for Poland to deal with state business.\nAll express their feelings, but things come to a halt when a letter arrives for Belfiore. It is from King Stanislaw announcing his safe arrival in Warsaw and releasing Belfiore from his task of impersonating him. In return, the king has created him Marshall of France. Before dropping the disguise, the \"King\" proclaims that Giulietta and Eduardo are to be married and, having received the Baron's consent, reads the true king's letter and reveals his true rank. He expresses his love for the Marchesa and all ends happily with the prospect of two weddings."},{"opera_title":"L' Africaine","composer":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","synopsis":"The opera depicts fictional events in the life of the explorer Vasco da Gama.\n\tPlace: Lisbon, at sea, and in an exotic new land.Time: late 15th century\n\tAct 1\n\tThe council chamber, Lisbon\n\tThe beautiful In\u00e8z is forced by her father, the Grand Admiral Don Diego, to marry Don P\u00e9dro instead of her true love, Vasco da Gama.

The wound remains unhealed; no herbs do more than briefly alleviate the pain, as does bathing in the holy lake. Amfortas and the knights of the grail hope for the advent of the promised healer, a pure fool, made wise by pity. The squires abuse the strange, wild woman, Kundry, and Gurnemanz, the oldest of the grail knights - not knowing that it was she who was responsible for Amfortas' wound - reproves them for their lack of charity; she may be, as they say, accursed, but she now lives under the protection of the grail. She was found almost lifeless in that place by Titurel, father of Amfortas, when he built the grail castle of Monsalvat.\nGurnemanz tells how angels brought the grail and spear to Titurel, to be guarded only by the pure in heart. Klingsor, although aspiring to the grail, was sinful and his self-castration made it impossible for him to serve the grail, though it did give him magic powers, which enabled him to transform the wilderness into a luxuriant garden in which beautiful women ensnared the knights. Parsifal is brought in carrying his bow and arrows, having killed a swan. He does not know who his father was, or even his own name, only that of his mother. Kundry explains that his mother had tried to bring him up cut off from the world, to save him from being killed in battle like his father. He remembers having seen knights and followed them and Kundry tells him that his mother had then died of grief. Hoping that Parsifal may prove to be the pure fool of the prophecy, Gurnemanz takes him to the castle, as the scene changes around them. The covered grail is carried before Amfortas and the voice of Titurel, entombed in the wall, is heard demanding that Amfortas unveil it and allow its powers of renewal to sustain him, but these powers also prolong Amfortas' life and suffering. He obeys reluctantly and blesses bread and wine which are distributed among the knights. Titurel is refreshed, but Amfortas suffers. Parsifal, who has watched in silent pity, is chased away angrily by Gurnemanz for not having understood anything of what he has seen.\nACT II\nKlingsor's magic castle\nKlingsor summons Kundry and orders her to seduce Parsifal. He derides her for clinging to the knights of the grail, as if to atone for the wrong she has done them. Klingsor hopes soon to possess the grail himself. He summons his knights to defend the castle against Parsifal, but laughs when they are defeated.\nHis tower disappears, replaced by a magic garden, in which girls lament their lovers' wounds and reproach Parsifal. Enchanted by their loveliness, he offers to play with them and they throng around him with a different kind of play in mind, until they are driven off by Kundry, now transformed into a beautiful woman.\nShe calls Parsifal by his name and gains his confidence by relating how she had known him in his childhood, reminding him of his mother's love and death, going on to describe his father's love for her and to promise him similar delights, kissing him passionately. At once he feels the pain of Amfortas' wound and realises that Kundry had seduced Amfortas. He is also consumed with guilt for his own youthful folly. He recoils from Kundry, who reproaches him with feeling for the sufferings of others, but not for hers, relating how she had laughed at Christ, begging him to bring her redemption by yielding to her; but he explains that her salvation will only be ensured by his refusal.\nShe curses him to a life of wandering like her own and calls on Klingsor for help. He appears on the tower, throwing the spear at Parsifal, who seizes it and makes the sign of the Cross, causing the tower to crumble and the garden to wither.\nACT III\nPleasant spring landscape in the domain of the grail\nGurnemanz, now old and grey, is living as a hermit. He finds Kundry, almost lifeless in a thicket and no longer wild. Parsifal returns, incurring Gurnemanz's reproaches (before he recognises him) for being armed on Good Friday. With joy he recognises Parsifal and the spear, and Parsifal explains that he has found his way back through great suffering to relieve the torment of Amfortas.\nAmfortas has refused to unveil the grail, so Titurel, deprived of its life-prolonging refreshment, has died. Parsifal's guilt weighs heavily on him and he seems about to faint, but Kundry brings water. She washes his feet and Gurnemanz bathes his head. Parsifal baptises Kundry and Gurnemanz leads him to the grail castle, as the scene gradually changes. The knights carry the body of Titurel and call on the unwilling Amfortas to unveil the grail once more. Parsifal cures him with a touch of the spear and unveils the grail, of which he is now the ruler, as the knights rejoice and Kundry falls lifeless."},{"opera_title":"Le Cid","composer":"Jules Massenet","synopsis":"Problems listening to these files?

Modern performing versions often somewhat adapt this storyline for convenience.\nPlace: ConstanceTime: 1414Events before the opera begins\nThe following is a summary of events which took place before the first act of the opera, some of which are only revealed in the course of the action.\nWhen he was young, the Jew El\u00e9azar had lived in Italy near Rome and witnessed the condemnation and executions of his sons as heretics by Count Brogni. El\u00e9azar himself was banished and forced to flee to Switzerland.\nDuring his journey, El\u00e9azar found a baby near death, abandoned inside a burnt-out house which turned out to be the home of the Count. Bandits had set fire to the house, attempting to kill the entire family of Brogni but unaware that the Count himself was in Rome at the time.\nEl\u00e9azar took the child, a girl, and raised her as his own daughter, naming her Rachel. Brogni discovered the ruins of his house and the bodies of his family upon his return. He subsequently became a priest and later a cardinal.\nAt the beginning of the opera, in 1414 Rachel (now a young woman) is living with her \"father\" in the city of Constance. The forces of the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund have defeated the Hussites, in battles where Prince Leopold has distinguished himself. The Council of Constance, convened by Antipope John XXIII, has been arranged to resolve Church matters.

As the people are singing various prayers, Brogni asks El\u00e9azar if his own daughter is still alive. El\u00e9azar says that she is and when Brogni asks where she can be found, El\u00e9azar points to the cauldron, saying \"There she is!\" He then climbs to his own death while the Cardinal falls on his knees.

After capture she chooses a free life with Gomatz rather than a good life with the Sultan. Allazim encourages the sultan to consider Gomatz as a man, not as a slave. The final surviving quartet suggests Zaide and Gomatz are sentenced to punishment or execution. This is where Mozart's manuscript breaks off.\nThere are similarities with Voltaire's play Za\u00efre (Zara) in which Za\u00efre, a Christian slave who had been captured as a baby falls in love with Osman, the Sultan of Jersusalem. Osman wrongly believes Za\u00efre and another Christian slave Nerestan (Gomatz in Mozart's opera) are lovers and kills Za\u00efre in a jealous rage and then kills himself. The elderly Lusignan, a prisoner of the Sultan (paralleled in the character Allazim) recognizes Zara and Nerestan as his children as she escorts him to safety. From the surviving arias we can deduce a few differences between Voltaire's play and Mozart's opera. By Act II of the opera Zaide, Gomatz, and possibly Allazim actually escape, only to be captured once more. In the opera there is no evidence that Mozart intended to cast Zaide, Gomatz and Allazim as a reunited family. Indeed, the original ending of Voltaire's play may have been too serious for contemporary tastes and may have been a reason for Mozart's leaving the project incomplete."},{"opera_title":"Oberon","composer":"Carl Maria von Weber","synopsis":"Act 1\nFairies sing around the sleeping Oberon in his bower.

Sergeant Meryll says that Elsie, the girl who fainted at the execution, and who has been placed in Meryll's charge, has recovered, but that her illness gave Dame Carruthers an excuse to take up quarters in his house while she nursed the girl. He has spurned the old woman's obvious overtures for years. Carruthers then happens by, together with her niece Kate, and notes that the latter heard Elsie talking in her sleep about her secret wedding. The other three leave Fairfax alone, pleased to find that his mystery wife is the fair Elsie. He decides to test her loyalty by pretending to woo his own wife, still disguised as Leonard. She rejects \"Leonard's\" overtures, as a married woman should, and he is about to reveal himself to her.\nJust then, a shot is heard from the wharf and everyone enters. Wilfred, with the jester's corroboration, declares that he struggled with someone creeping about, discovered it was Colonel Fairfax, who dove into the river, and seizing an arquebus, Wilfred shot him dead. The Lieutenant orders the Yeomen to search for the body, and Wilfred is celebrated as a hero. Elsie, Fairfax, Phoebe and Point are left alone, and Point asks Elsie, as she is now free, to marry him. Fairfax, still disguised as \"Leonard\", tells Point that he doesn't know how to woo (it is not to be done in the manner of a jester!), and he undertakes to instruct Point in this art, following this up with a most effective demonstration on Elsie. Point, slow to see that Fairfax is wooing the girl for himself (and that Elsie has fallen for the heroic \"Leonard\"), finally protests.

Phoebe, seeing her adored Fairfax pledged to another, bursts into tears, while Point, shocked by the turn of events, wishes he was dead.\nWilfred sees Phoebe weeping and she, rendered incautious by anger and hurt, and by her scorn for the jailer, inadvertently reveals that \"Leonard\" is in fact Fairfax. Realizing the game is up, she desperately buys Wilfred's silence by agreeing to marry him (after a long engagement). The real Leonard then returns and announces that Fairfax's reprieve has finally arrived. Sergeant Meryll enters, followed surreptitiously by Dame Carruthers. Phoebe tells him of her folly and goes with Wilfred, whereupon Dame Carruthers reveals herself to Meryll and threatens to expose the three schemers who had freed Fairfax illegally. He resignedly buys her silence with his offer of marriage.\nElsie arrives joyfully for her wedding to the man she still knows as \"Leonard\", but the Lieutenant arrives and announces that her husband Fairfax lives. Fairfax arrives dressed for the wedding, but Elsie, distraught over the loss of \"Leonard\", does not turn to see his face. He teases his wife, keeping up the pretence for another minute. Elsie begs for his mercy, to free her to go to her love, \"Leonard\", but he says that his heart is like a \"massive rock\" and claims her as his bride. Finally Elsie turns to see his face, and finally recognises him as her adored one. All once again erupt into joy, except the broken-hearted Jack Point. Tearfully, he reprises the song that he had earlier sung with Elsie, The Merryman and his Maid, with wrenching sorrow. Elsie \"drops a tear\" for Point, but turns back to her love.

Believing these visions to be a sign from God, he resolves, against Pal\u00e9mon's advice, to return to Alexandria, convert Tha\u00efs to Christianity, and persuade her to enter a convent.\nScene 2\nAthana\u00ebl arrives in Alexandria and visits his old friend Nicias, a wealthy voluptuary. Nicias welcomes him with open arms and reveals himself to be Tha\u00efs's current lover. Upon hearing Athana\u00ebl's plan, he laughs and warns him that the revenge of Venus can be terrible. Nevertheless, he procures clothing for his friend in preparation for a feast that evening at which Tha\u00efs will appear.

However, first he has to choose between Fortuna, the provider of the world's good things, and the reliable, trustworthy Constanza.\nScipio asks for time to think. Neither in his heart nor mind can he take in what has happened, nor can he choose.\nFortuna and Constanza permit him to ask questions: he wants to know where he is. He fell asleep in the kingdom of Massinissa, but now has no idea of where he is. Fortuna tells him that he is in the Temple of Heaven. The magnificent lights are the stars against the blue background of the universe. He can hear the music of the harmony of the spheres.\nScipio asks who creates this harmony. Constanza replies that the power behind it moves the spheres like strings on a zither, finely tuned by hand and ear. Scipio responds by asking why this sound is inaudible to mortals on earth. Constanza explains that this is due to the inadequacy of their senses; looking at the sun, they see only the glare, whilst hearing a waterfall, they know nothing of its destructive power. Scipio then asks who dwells in this eternal world. Fortuna indicates an approaching cortege - heroes, his forefathers, Rome's greatest sons. Scipio sees the dead Publius and asks if dead heroes live here. Publius assures him that the light of immortality resurrects the body, freeing it from the burden of mortality. He who has thought of, felt for and devoted himself to others will live forever; those who have lived only for themselves are not deserving of immortality. Scipio goes to seek his father. He is delighted to find him, but surprised when it appears that this joy is not mutual. His father Emilio tells him that joy in heaven is complete, because it is not accompanied by suffering; he points to the Earth, small and miserable and covered in cloud, the home of mad misguided people, indifferent to other's pain.\nAghast at the sight of the Earth, Scipio begs his father to be allowed to remain in the eternal land. However, he is told by Publius that he has a great mission to complete on Earth - to destroy an enemy, after making his choice between Constanza and Fortuna.\nScipio asks Fortuna what kind of help she can offer him in completing his task. She tells him of her power to destroy and create, to corrupt innocence and empower evil. Who can resist her? Constanza says that only she can bestow the power of loyalty. Fortuna cannot go beyond the limits dictated by Constanza. Virtue can only occasionally be defeated by violence, while evil deeds, unlike good ones, are transient. Fortuna can manage rare strikes, but cannot deprive heroes of hope and faith. Thus Scipio chooses Constanza, braving Fortuna's anger unafraid, because the eternal kingdom is dearer to his heart.\nFortuna, furious, calls plagues down as vengeance on Scipio. He however keeps his courage through a foul storm. He reawakes in the kingdom of Massinissa, feeling the presence of Constanza beside him. The moral behind his dream was a hymn of praise to the eternal virtues offered by heaven, a model for all those who believe in God. In the final scene Licenza praises Scipio's choice and explains that the real protagonist of the play is not Scipio, but the dedicatee - Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus (Girolamo) Graf von Colloredo."},{"opera_title":"La Donna del lago","composer":"Giaochino Rossini","synopsis":"Act 1\nScene 1\nShepherds are watching flocks at dawn on the shores of Loch Katrine, and men in the nearby forests are hunting (Chorus: \"Del di la messaggiera\").

Enraged, Wozzeck is about to hit her, when she stops him, saying even her father never dared lay a hand on her. Her statement \"better a knife in my belly than your hands on me\" plants in Wozzeck's mind the idea for his subsequent revenge.\n\tScene 4 (Scherzo)\n\tAmong a crowd, Wozzeck sees Marie dancing with the Drum-major. After a brief hunter's chorus, Andres asks Wozzeck why he is sitting by himself.

Wozzeck enters, and upon seeing Margret, dances with her and pulls her onto his lap. He insults her, and then asks her to sing him a song. She sings, but then notices blood on his hand and elbow; everyone begins shouting at him, and Wozzeck, now agitated and obsessed with his blood, rushes out of the tavern.\n\tScene 4 (Invention on a 6-Note Chord)\n\tHaving returned to the murder scene, Wozzeck becomes obsessed with the thought that the knife he killed Marie with will incriminate him, and throws it into the pond. When the blood-red moon appears again Wozzeck, fearing that he has not thrown the knife far enough from shore and also wanting to wash away the blood staining his clothing and hands, wades into the pond and drowns. The Captain and the Doctor, passing by, hear Wozzeck moaning and rush off in fright.

Then Mina enters distraught and remorseful, confessing her adultery (ciel, ch'io respiri \/ \"Heavens, let me breathe\"). She prays as Briano and Aroldo enter, the latter concerned about his wife's state of mind given that she had been his inspiration during the long period that he was away fighting the Saracens. He explains that Briano, now his faithful companion, had saved his life. Taking her hand, he is surprised to see that she is not wearing his mother's ring, which she had received upon his mother's death. He demands to know where it is, and tries to get to he bottom of her state of mind but they are interrupted by the return of Briano with news of the arrival of guests. Both men leave.\nMina's father, Egberto, enters and observes her writing a letter. Already suspicious of what he believes has been going on between Godvino and Mina, he demands to know if she is writing to Godvino. Snatching away the unfinished letter, he reads the words addressed not to Godvino but to Aroldo - \"I am no longer worthy of you\" - and realizes that he was not mistaken. He begins to demand that Mina keep silent and ensure Aroldo's continued love (Duet: Dite che il fallo a tergere \/ \"You mean that your heart lacks the strength to wipe away your guilt?\") while she further resists. Again, demanding that she obey him, he continues to make his demands: (Duet: Ed io pure in faccio agl'uomini \/ \"And must I smother my rage....Must I conquer my shame?\").

However, unseen by Godvino, Briano has entered and observes Godvino's actions. He grows suspicious: \"a friend of Aroldo?\", he wonders. The guests flow into the room and Godvino is absorbed within the group. They all express their joy at Aroldo's return. Briano approaches Aroldo and explains what he has seen, pointing across the room to Enrico, Mina's cousin, as the one who planted the letter and who then picked up the book. But he is amongst the group and is dressed in the same way as Godvino, so there is some confusion. Suspicion falls on Enrico as Aroldo reveals that his honour has been betrayed. He tells of a similar situation in Palestine: Aria: Vi fu in Palestina \/ \"In Palestine there was once a certain man....\", and confronts Mina, since he knows that she has a key to the book and believes that it too contains a secret letter. Mina's attempts to stall fail, and Aroldo breaks open the locked book and a letter drops from it to the floor. Quickly stepping forward, Egberto picks it up stating that no one shall see it.

Egberto comes across the couple, sends Mina away, and then confronts Godvino, offering him the choice of two proffered swords. Godvino refuses to take one. The older man continues to press him (\"Are you dead to any sense of honour?\"), accusing him of cowardice and stating that he will reveal him to be a bastard. At that remark, Godvino accepts the challenge and the two men fight until interrupted by the arrival of Aroldo. Stating that \"I speak in the name of God\", Aroldo tries to force the two men to stop their fighting. In disarming him, he takes Godvino's hand only to have Egberto question how Aroldo can take the hand of the very man who has betrayed him. With Mina's return, Aroldo finally realizes the truth (Aria: Ah no! \u00e8 impossibile \/ \"Ah no! It is impossible. Tell me at least that I have been mistaken\"). Finally, Egberto insists that Aroldo must punish the right person and not Mina, and Aroldo attempts to return Godvino's sword and commence fighting him. Godvino refuses.

Taking up his sword again, Egberto expresses his joy that one of the two of them will soon die: Oh gioia inesprimibile \/ \"Oh inexpressible joy...\" He leaves.\nAroldo enters with Godvino. The two men sit down to talk and Aroldo asks his rival what he would do if Mina were free. Mina is then summonded and Godvino is instructed to conceal himself and listen to the couple's conversation. Aroldo explains to Mina that they need to talk since he will be leaving that evening and that they must part (Opposto e il calle che in avvenire \/ \"In the future, our lives must follow opposite paths\"). He adds that she can redeem herself from dishonour by marrying the man who has captured her heart, and he presents her with a divorce paper to sign. She does so, declaring that they are free of each other. But she states that, in spite of everything, she could not be another man's wife and that she will always love Aroldo.

When the answer is \"yes\", Aroldo swears that Godvino must die, indicating that her seducer in the next room.

A boat barely survives the storm and it arrives on land carrying Mina and Egberto, now shipwrecked. Seeking shelter, Egberto knocks on a stranger's door and, to his surprise, Aroldo appears, but Aroldo is angry, since he and Briano have fled to this remote place with no expectation of ever meeting Mina or her father again. In spite of Aroldo's objections, Egberto pleads with him to accept Mina as his daughter, if not as her husband. Mina tries to calm her father (Taci, mido padre, calmati \/ \"Be silent, father, calm yourself\"). In the hope of obtaining forgiveness (in a trio involving Egberto, Mina and Aroldo) she begs for a \"last word\" with Aroldo (Allora che gl'anni \/ \"When the weight of years...\").

Their rites however have been defiled by a nymph whose treachery has brought a curse on them. To propitiate the angry goddess, two faithful lovers must be sacrificed each year to a lake monster until a faithful lover can be found to offer his own life. Fidelity, therefore, is at a premium in Cumae, and victims are hard to find.\n\tThe plot is \"part thriller about lovers being sacrificed to a monster, part burlesque sending up pseudo-classical and early romantic emotions\".\n\tAct 1\n\tA temple dedicated to Diana\n\tMelibeo presides over preliminary rites on a day of sacrifice, assisted by Lindoro and Nerina, whose affair is coming to an end; Lindoro is tired of Nerina and hopes for a liaison with the shepherdess 'Celia'. Lindoro's sister Amaranta, recently arrived in Cumae, comes to worship. She is on the look-out for a lover but startled to hear of the risk in true love. Melibeo suggests that as High Priests are exempt, she might give her attentions to him.

Nerina returns with Fileno, who, to his amazement and delight recognises Celia - alive and well. He is unaware of the fatal penalty awaiting faithful lovers, but Celia, spotting Melibeo waiting to pounce, spurns Fileno to save his life: naturally he is angry and desolate.\n\tFileno, intent on self-destruction, goes off followed by Celia, who is followed by Lindoro and Perrucchetto, who sees in Celia a more enticing prospect than Amaranta, who in turn is offended and turns back to Melibeo. Perrucchetto, rejected by Celia returns to make peace with Amaranta but then chases Nerina, infuriating Amaranta.\n\tA dark wood\n\tMelibeo tries to blackmail Celia into the match with Lindoro suggested by Amaranta - she must consent or else die with Fileno. Celia asks Nerina to warn Fileno that his life is in danger. Although Nerina agrees to help, as she has now fallen in love with Fileno her help is not altogether disinterested.\n\tAs the first act reaches its climax, Melibeo has Fileno tied up. Fileno curses Celia when he learns she is to marry Lindoro. At this point Nerina enters pursued by satyrs who carry off numerous nymphs, including Celia.\n\tAct 2\n\tA grove\n\tCelia is rescued by shepherds. Melibeo takes stock of the situation. If he could make a match between Nerina and Fileno that would leave Celia free for Lindoro and then he can claim Amaranta.

Fileno is at first grateful, but seeing Celia with Lindoro pretends ardent love for Nerina to spite Celia. She remonstrates with Nerina who advises that she forget Fileno.\n\tFileno resolves to stab himself, but first carves a message of love to Celia on a tree trunk.

Melibeo, seeing this, changes his plans again: if Nerina can lure Perrucchetto into the cave with Celia they can be 'framed' as lovers and sent to the monster. This is accomplished and the pair are robed as sacrificial victims.

The Baroness and Erika refuse to come to the party to hear his announcement of Anatol and Vanessa's engagement. The doctor goes to fetch them, while Vanessa tells Anatol her fears. Finally Erika, who, unbeknownst to everyone else, is pregnant, comes downstairs, but faints, clutching her stomach, while the doctor is making the announcement. She recovers and flees into the freezing weather in order to abort her child. (In the original she says, \"His child! It must not be born!\" which makes clear her motivation for going out into the cold, but this line is dropped in the revision.)\n\tAct 4\n\tVanessa is happy when Erika is found alive, and she asks Anatol why Erika is acting so strangely and whether he thinks that she loves him. He explains that she does not. Continuing in her delusionary state, Vanessa begs Anatol to take her away. Meanwhile, Erika confesses to the Baroness that she had been pregnant, but is no longer. As Vanessa and Anatol finalize their preparations to move to Paris, Vanesa asks Erika why she ran away. The niece replies that she was just being foolish, and Vanessa tells her that she may never come back to the house where she has been living. After the couple leaves, Erika covers the mirrors and closes up the house, just as Vanessa had done before her. She says that it is now her turn to wait."},{"opera_title":"Die Lustige Weiber von Windsor","composer":"Otto Nicolai","synopsis":"The Merry Wives of Windsor\nACT I\nSir John Falstaff sends identical love letters to Frau Fluth and Frau Reich.

They dance together (Dance of the Polovtsian Maidens). Konchakovna joins in the singing hoping that her own lover will join here soon (Konchakovna's Cavatina). The Russian prisoners arrive from their day's work and express their gratitide when fed by Konchakovna and the maidens. Their guards retire for the night leaving just Ovlur, a Christian, in charge. Vladimir, son of Igor, sings of his hope that his love will soon join him now that the day is fading (Vladimir's Cavatina). His love is Konchakovna. She comes and the two sing of their love and their desire to marry (Love Duet). While her father will consent to the marriage, they know that his will not. They part when they hear Igor coming. He sings of his disgrace and torment at being captured with his followers dead (Prince Igor's Aria). Only his wife, he feels, will be loyal. He hopes for the chance to regain his honour. Ovlur urges Igor to escape and the prince agrees to think about it. Khan Konchak asks him if all is well (Konchak's Aria) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak says that as Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows what it is to be a captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak's glory (Polovtsian Dances).\n\tAct 3\n\tThe Polovtsian camp\n\tThe Polovtsian army returns in triumph singing the praise of Khan Gzak (Polovtsian March). Konchak sings of the sack of Putivl and other victories and confidently predicts that they will soon capture all of Russia. Igor and his son Vladimir have their worst fears confirmed by the new captives. Vladimir and the other prisoners urge Igor to escape, but he is at first reluctant, singing of his shame and saying that it is the duty of the other Russian princes to save the homeland (Igor's Monologue, Mariinsky edition only). Ovlur now arrives to say that he has prepared horses for Igor and Vladimir and Igor now agrees to escape. The distressed Konchakovna comes, challenging Vladimir to show his love by either taking her with him or by staying. Igor urges his son to come, but Vladimir feels unable to leave Konchakovna who threatens to wake the camp. Eventually Igor flees alone and Konchakovna sounds the alarm. She and her father refuse to let the Polovtsy kill Vladimir. Instead Konchak orders the death of the guards and marries Vladimir to his daughter. As for Igor, Konchak thinks more of him for his escape.\n\tAct 4\n\tDawn in Putivl\n\tYaroslavna weeps at her separation from Igor and the defeat of his army, blaming the very elements themselves for helping the enemy (Yaroslavna's Lament). Peasant women blame not the wind but Khan Gzak for the devastation. As Yaroslavna looks around to acknowledge the destruction, she sees two riders in the distance who turn out to be Igor and Ovlur. The two lovers sing of their joy of being reunited and of the expectation that Ivan will lead the Russians to victory against the Khan. Unaware of Igor's return, Skula and Yeroshka, the drunken gudok players, sing a song that mocks him. Then they notice him in the distance. After a moment of panic about what will happen to them, Skula says that they should rely on their cunning and decides on a plan that will save them. They ring the church bells to summon a crowd. Although people at first treat them with suspicion, the gudok players manage to convince the crowd that Igor has returned and the boyars that they are loyal followers of the true prince and not Galitsky.

He is not even disturbed by a brawl between the tenor and the wig maker. The dancing master, in charge of the commedia dell'arte troupe whose production is to follow the opera seria, explains the situation to Zerbinetta. The composer is struck by her beauty but horrified when he learns that her performance is to follow his opera. The music master tries in vain to console him.\n\tThe dancing master explains to Zerbinetta the advantages of her show following the opera, while the music master tries to soothe the prima donna by telling her that only Ariadne will be remembered the next day. The major domo announces that his master has decided that the two works must be played simultaneously, so that a fireworks display can start punctually at nine o'clock. Besides, it has occurred to his master that a scene so stark as a desert island would be out of keeping with his sumptuous mansion, and he wishes its bareness to be relieved by the addition of the commedia dell'arte figures.\n\tThe music master restrains the composer from leaving by reminding him that he needs the fee to live on, and the music master and dancing master put their heads together to devise a solution, the latter explaining that Zerbinetta, as a mistress of improvisation, will be able to fit in with the opera and to give her companions the lead. The prima donna approaches the music master while the tenor whispers to the composer, each trying to keep his part intact at the expense of the other.\n\tThe dancing master tells Zerbinetta the plot of the opera - that Ariadne is a princess deserted by her lover and longing for death. Zerbinetta's interpretation - that Ariadne is only waiting for another lover - stirs the composer into trying to explain that Ariadne is a high-souled being who can only love one man; but when she learns that Ariadne is rescued by Bacchus, she declares her point proved and assures the composer he will soon know more about women. She then tells her companions her version of the story, in which they are travellers who have landed on Ariadne's desert island and must cheer her up when the chance occurs.\n\tThen she turns her charms on the composer and he is smitten, standing in a daze when she leaves. The music master convinces the prima donna that the best way she can demonstrate her superiority to Zerbinetta is not to refuse to take part but to show her up on the stage. The composer is rhapsodising about the beauty and power of music when the appearance of the commedia dell'arte troupe about to go on stage brings him abruptly back to earth.\nTHE OPERA\nA desert island\n\tAriadne lies sleeping at the mouth of a cave, watched by Naiad, Dryad and Echo who comment on her ceaseless lamenting. She wakes and continues to grieve, watched sympathetically from the wings by Zerbinetta and her companions. The nymphs try to rouse her, but she refuses to stir and declares her intention of waiting for death.\n\tZerbinetta and her companions make a vain attempt to attract her attention and Harlequin sings about the passing of sorrow and the return of love; but she does not even lift her head. She continues to long for the purity of the land of death.\n\tAs Harlequin, Brighella, Scaramuccio and Truffaldino sing and dance in front of Ariadne, Zerbinetta reflects that although she herself would have no trouble finding one of them attractive, Ariadne is unmoved. So she dismisses them and tries to explain to Ariadne that although they are of different stations in life, yet both are women with a common fate. Others, too, have been abandoned; even she has cursed the faithlessness of men; but then, women too are not above changing their hearts. Every time she thinks she will be constant to a lover, a new love tempts her and she falls. Each one is welcomed like a god, but this does not stop her from succumbing to a new god.\n\tHarlequin admires her sermon but comments that she has wasted it on deaf ears and proceeds to woo her. She evades him and flirts with the other three, who are also courting her. She flits from one to the other, then suddenly leaves them and runs off with Harlequin.\n\tThe nymphs run in with news for Ariadne of the arrival of a god. They relate his upbringing by nymphs, his arrival at the island of the enchantress Circe, her attempt to enslave him and his escape. Bacchus appears, rejoicing in his freedom from Circe, and Ariadne, hearing his voice, thinks he is the messenger of death, a delusion she continues to labor under when they stand face to face. Bacchus is struck by her beauty and asks if she is the goddess of the island and is she, too, a sorceress with the power to transform men. She greets him expecting death, but he assures her that only now is life beginning for both. She faints and thinks she has died, astonished by the magical transformation which seems to have overtaken her, while Bacchus exclaims that hers is the magic which has transformed him. They do not heed Zerbinetta who pops back to remind the audience that the coming of a new god was how she had described the coming of a new lover."},{"opera_title":"Cavalleria Rusticana","composer":"Pietro Mascagni","synopsis":"ONE AND ONLY ACT\nA Square in a Sicilian village early on Easter Sunday\nBefore the curtain rises Turiddu can be heard serenading Lola.\nSantuzza nervously approaches Turiddu's mother, Mamma Lucia, as she opens her wine shop, and asks where Turiddu is.

Princess Helene and Lieutenant Niki of the Army had earlier became lovers and soon were married in the splendid hall whereupon the father of the Princess, Joachim decided the apparent heir to his throne. In spite of this, Lieutenant Niki appeared to be sceptical of the prospect of being a Prince as it was not financially beneficial nor does it come with the elevated status which he sought. The marriage has also raised a few eyebrows among the courtiers as Niki was just a common soldier and the choice of marriage has been a hasty one. Niki also distanced himself from the Prince's favour when the former acknowledged the hasty marriage and raised suggestions for a separate bedroom from the newly-wed Princess. It also appeared to the dismayed Prince that Lieutenant Niki favours his hometown of Vienna rather than the interests of the State. Lieutenant Niki then chooses to leave the palace secretly with his comrade Lieutenant Montschi for a pleasurable evening in the Beer-Garden. Through this troubled backdrop, a scheming Count Lothar, who is envious of Niki hatches a plan of betrayal.\nAct Two\nAt the Garten der Wirtschaft, Niki meets Franzi, a ladies' orchestra leader and is attracted to her.

(August 2008)\n\tSummary\n\tThe play takes place on the doorstep of a tenement on the East Side of Manhattan on two brutally hot days in 1946. The story focuses on two plotlines: the romance between Rose Maurrant and her neighbor Sam Kaplan; and on the extramarital affair of Rose's mother, Anna, which is eventually discovered by Rose's irritable father, Frank. The show portrays the ordinary romances, squabbles and gossips of the neighbors, as the mounting tensions involving the Maurrant family eventually build into a tragedy of epic proportions.\n\tAct 1\n\tAs the curtain rises, we are introduced to some of the residents of the apartment block where the action takes place. Emma Jones and Greta Fiorentino lament the incredible heatwave that is gripping New York (Ain't It Awful, The Heat?). They are joined by another neighbor Olga Olsen, who tells of the stress of dealing with her newborn baby and her husband Carl, and an old man, Abraham Kaplan, who sings of the murders and scandals in the press, whilst joining in with the opening number. Henry Davis, the janitor, enters from the basement and sings of his ambitions to greater things (I Got A Marble And A Star). Young Willie Maurrant enters and calls for his mother, who enters at the window and throws him a dime to buy a soda. The three women (Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Fiorentino and Mrs. Olsen) persuade Mrs. Maurrant to come downstairs and be sociable, and as she descends, they gossip about the rumour that Mrs. Maurrant and Steve Sankey, the milkman, have been having an affair (Get A Load Of That). Mrs. Maurrant comes down to chat and Mrs. Olsen goes back down to her cellar apartment to tend to her baby. Sam Kaplan comes out of the house and asks after Mrs. Maurrant's daughter, Rose, but she hasn't got back from work yet. He leaves to go to the library.\n\tDaniel Buchanan enters, jittery; he's nervous because his wife is upstairs about to have a baby. He and the women sing of the perils of childbirth in a short Arietta, When A Woman Has A Baby. Just as he runs upstairs to tend to his wife, Mrs. Maurrant's husband Frank comes home. He mentions that he is going on a business trip to New Haven tomorrow, and argues with his wife about Rose not being home yet (She Shouldn't Be Staying Out Nights). Fuming, he storms into the house, just as George Jones returns home from work and chats with the ladies for a while. Anna Maurrant sings an aria about the importance of putting your faith in a brighter tomorrow (Somehow I Never Could Believe). Steve Sankey enters and a tense scene ensues between him and the suspecting women. Almost immediately after he departs, Mrs. Maurrant heads off in the same direction, under the guise of going to look for her son. Mr. Jones, Mr. Olsen, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Fiorentino sing more about the scandal (Whatcha Think Of That). Mrs. Olsen runs in excited and says that she has just seen Sankey and Mrs. Maurrant standing close together around the back of a local warehouse.\n\tLippo Fiorentino returns home from work with an armful of ice cream cones for everybody. The two Fiorentino's, the two Olsen's, Mr. Jones and Henry Davis sing a jubilant sextet praising ice cream (Ice Cream Sextet). Maurrant has been watching, and when his wife comes back he questions her about where she's been. She tells him she's been looking for Willie, and Maurrant and Abraham Kaplan argue about parenting, and later economics. Kaplan uses the example of the Hildebrand family who live upstairs, who are run by a struggling single mother who is unable to pay the rent, to illustrate his point. Maurrant and Kaplan's argument almost becomes physical, but the neighbors and Kaplan's granddaughter Shirley hold the two men back. Maurrant sings about how he longs for a return to traditional moral values in Let Things Be Like They Always Was. Immediately after, Jennie Hildebrand and other high-school girls enter the street coming home from their graduation ceremony. The ensemble sings a jubilant celebration number, Wrapped In A Ribbon And Tied In A Bow. Steve Sankey's entrance causes an abrupt end to the celebrations. After the awkward silence of the neighbors forces him to leave, Sam brings Willie Maurrant on in tears. Willie has been fighting with a local kid and Sam stepped in to break it up. Mr. Maurrant leaves to go to the local bar to have a drink, warning that there'll be trouble if Rose isn't home by the time he gets back, whilst Mrs. Maurrant takes Willie upstairs. As soon as they leave, the neighbors all begin gossiping about the Maurrant family. Sam gets passionately upset, chiding the neighbors for gossiping so much behind their backs, and then storms off.\n\tAll the neighbors say goodnight and go to bed, except Mr. Jones, who goes to the bar to shoot some pool. Sam returns onstage and sings of his crippling loneliness (Lonely House). Sam goes into the house, then Rose enters with her boss, Harry Easter, who has walked her home. Easter attempts to charm Rose, taking her in his arms and kissing her. He then tries to win her over with a tempting song, promising her that if she were to run away with him he could get her a gig on Broadway (Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?). Rose, however, sticks to her convictions, and sings a Cavatina about how she will always choose true love over showy promises (What Good Would The Moon Be?). Rose sees her father returning home and tells Easter to leave. Maurrant questions her about who she was talking to, and gets angry when she tells him that they had been out dancing. He goes upstairs to bed, furious. Buchanan rushes out of the house and asks Rose to go and phone the doctor, as his wife's baby is about to be born. He heads back upstairs, and as Rose is leaving, she passes young Mae Jones and her suitor, Dick McGann. The two have been out dancing and are flirting, and they sing a fast-paced jitterbug about their infatuation with one another (Moon-faced, Starry-eyed). After they dance on the sidewalk, they passionately run upstairs into the house, after saying a drunken good-night to Rose, who has returned from phoning the doctor.\n\tMae's brutish elder brother Vincent returns home, and begins harassing Rose. Sam sees him hassling her out of the window, and comes outside to confront him, however Vincent violently lays him out on the sidewalk. Vincent is about to continue his attack when his mother, Mrs. Jones, comes outside to see what the commotion is. He immediately seizes up and innocently goes upstairs at his mother's order. Sam and Rose are left alone, and Sam is embarrassed that he was humiliated by Vincent in front of Rose. Sam laments the terrible strife of living in the slums, but Rose calms him down by reminding him of a poem he once read her (Remember That I Care). Dr. Wilson arrives and goes upstairs to tend to Mrs. Buchanan, and Mr. Maurrant calls Rose and tells her to go to bed. Sam and Rose share a kiss on the sidewalk, and then Rose runs up to bed, just as Henry Davis comes upstairs and starts sweeping the stoop for the night (I Got A Marble And A Star (Reprise)). Rose calls goodnight to Sam from the window and Sam is left alone on the midnight street as the curtain slowly falls to end Act 1.\n\tAct 2\n\tScene 1: Daybreak, the next morning\n\tMr. Jones drunkenly returns home from the bar and reels into the house. Dr. Wilson leaves the house, telling Buchanan to let his wife get plenty of rest, and Dick McGann and Mae Jones share a much less passionate goodbye in the cold light of day than their energetic exchanges the night before. Willie Maurrant, Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Henry's daughter Grace, and other local children play an energetic game (Catch Me If You Can), which ends in a large scuffle. Rose calls for them to stop it from the window, whilst Sam comes outside and physically breaks the fight up. The children all disperse. Sam and Rose have a brief conversation, as Rose tells him that she has to go to the funeral of the head of her real estate firm this morning. Shirley comes outside and tells Sam to come in for breakfast, as Rose goes back inside to do the dishes. Buchanan comes outside and tells the Fiorentino's that he has had a little baby girl in the night. Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Maurrant enter, and Mrs. Jones asks her about Mrs. Buchanan, who Mrs. Maurrant has been looking after all night. Mrs. Jones leaves to walk her dog, and Mrs. Maurrant leaves to go to the grocery store. Rose and Mr. Maurrant come out of the house and Rose tries to persuade him to be nicer to her mother. Mrs. Maurrant returns and the three have a family argument about Mr. Maurrant's behaviour. Mrs. Maurrant asks him nonchalantly how long he'll be gone on his business trip for, and Mr. Maurrant accuses her of having an affair, which she denies. He leaves in a rage, and Mrs. Maurrant and Rose lament his behaviour (There'll Be Trouble). Willie comes on and Rose chides him for looking scruffy. Willie and Rose have a verbal disagreement and Rose quickly storms into the house. Mrs. Maurrant tells him that that is no way to talk to his sister, and that she is relying on him to turn into a good man when he is older (A Boy Like You). Willie leaves for school and Mrs. Maurrant goes into the house, as Rose comes out. Shirley Kaplan comes out of the house and asks Rose why she spends so much time with Sam, when he should be concentrating on his work. Shirley leaves for work, and Vincent Jones comes out of the house and starts harassing Rose again, but promptly leaves as Sam comes out of the house. Rose mentions Easter's tempting offer of running away to Sam, and Sam gets upset, saying that she would be better off running away with him, and the two sing of their intention to run away together (We'll Go Away Together). Easter arrives to walk Rose to the funeral, and the two leave. Sam goes into the house, as Sankey appears. Mrs. Maurrant appears at her window and tells him to come upstairs, as Mr. Maurrant has gone on his business trip and Rose will be at the funeral all morning. As Sankey hurries upstairs he passes Sam coming out of the house, who looks up at the window and sees Mrs. Maurrant pulling the shades shut. Sam sits on the stoop and reads a book, as James Henry, a city-marshall, and Fred Cullen, his assistant, appear. They call Henry Davis up and tell him that they're here to dispossess the Hildebrand family, and that since she has made no arrangements to have the furniture taken away, they'll have to dump it on the sidewalk. Henry goes back into the cellar as the two men enter the house. Mr. Maurrant returns, having changed his mind about the business trip. He sees the shades pulled shut and becomes furious. Sam pleads with him not to enter the house but he pushes him aside and runs upstairs. Mrs. Maurrant is heard screaming, and then two gunshots. Sankey appears at the window in terror, he tries to escape but Maurrant pulls him back inside and shoots him. Panic ensues, as Maurrant exits the house, covered in blood, and points his revolver at the crowd of gatherers in order to make his escape. Policemen, paramedics, concerned neighbors flood the scene. Rose returns from the funeral and sees the concerned crowd. Sam tries to keep her back but she cannot be restrained. The ensemble sings a tragic chorus number about the killing, The Woman Who Lived Up There. Mrs. Maurrant's body is brought out of the house on a stretcher and taken to the hospital and the citizens rush after the ambulance, as Rose, quietly crying in Sam's arms, follows. The curtain slowly falls as the two city-marshalls continue bringing the Hildebrand furniture out onto the sidewalk.\n\tScene 2: Mid-afternoon, the same day\n\tTwo young nursemaids appear at the house and sing about the scandal of the murder that has already spread around the city, as they try to quiet the children they are looking after (Lullaby). As the nursemaids leave, Rose enters, dressed in black. She asks Officer Murphy, the policeman who is still in her apartment, if they have found her father yet, and he tells her that they haven't. Sam enters and tells Rose that he has taken Willie from school round to her aunt's house. Shirley enters and expresses her condolences to Rose, and the two of them go up to Rose's apartment together, as Rose is afraid to go up alone. Sam tells his grandfather that the police are going to make him testify against Maurrant, when two shots are heard in the distance. Buchanan and Olsen run on and tell Sam and Rose (who has run out of the house, alerted by the noise) that the police have found her father hiding in the basement of a house down the street. Two policemen bring on Maurrant, who is covered in blood and dirt. The officers are taking him away when he begs for one minute with his daughter, which they grant him. He and Rose talk about the murder, as the crowd looks on (He Loved Her Too). The officers take Maurrant off, and Rose and Sam are left alone onstage. Rose starts to enter the house when Sam asks what she's going to do. She tells him she'll go away, but when he says that he'll go with her like they discussed that morning, Rose says she has to go off alone. Sam finally confesses to Rose that he is in love with her, and that his life is nothing without her. Rose says that her parents have proved that two people do not belong to be together, and she says goodbye to Sam (Don't Forget The Lilac Bush). Shirley comes out of the house and hands Rose a suitcase full of her things. Rose starts walking off, then returns and swiftly kisses Sam, but he breaks away and goes abruptly into the house. Rose stands looking after him, then picks up her bag and walks off. Mrs. Fiorentino, Mrs. Olsen and Mrs. Jones appear and immediately begin gossiping about Rose and Easter hanging around on the street late last night (Ain't It Awful, The Heat?

As he looks back over a long life of study as well as action, he muses that he has seen much evil and good, though the latter has never been perfect. Meant to lead others, he feels that he has lived in a state of confusion and wonders who has blessed him. In 1797, shortly after the mutiny at the Nore by British seamen, he was in command of the Indomitable, fighting against the French.\nACT I\nSCENE 1: Early morning on board the Indomitable\nSailors are scrubbing the deck. The Novice accidentally falls foul of the Bosun, who orders Squeak, a corporal, to give him 20 lashes. The cutter which had been dispatched under the command of Mr Ratcliffe, the Second Lieutenant, to board a merchant vessel, The Rights o' Man, to impress men, arrives back with three sailors.\nUnder the supervision of Mr Redburn, the First Lieutenant, and Mr Flint, the Sailing Master, John Claggart, the Master-at-Arms, examines the recruits. Red Whiskers is old and unco-operative, Arthur Jones is younger, but not promising, but it is the third man, Billy Budd, who attracts instant admiration, even from the sardonic Claggart, who describes him as a \"King's bargain,\" despite his defect - an intermittent stammer. He knows nothing of his antecedents, having been a foundling, is unable to read, but can sing.\nHe is assigned to the foretop and accepts eagerly, bidding a cheerful farewell to his old ship, whose name, Rights o' Man, arouses suspicion in the minds of the officers that he is a potential mutineer. They warn Claggart to keep an eye on him, but he, aware that Budd is no danger, reflects that he knows more of men's weaknesses than they do. He orders Squeak to wage a campaign of petty irritation against Billy, promising to stand by him if he is caught, but warning him against Billy's temper and fists.\nThe Novice, barely able to stand after his punishment, is supported by his friend. Claggart is umoved by his plight, but Billy, who has never seen blood shed for no reason, is appalled. Dansker, an old sailor, warns Billy against \"Jemmy Legs\" - Claggart. Learning that the Captain's name is nicknamed \"Starry\" Vere, and that he is admired by the men, Billy swears to serve him loyally.\nSCENE 2: Captain Vere's cabin\nVere invites the First Lieutenant and Sailing Master to join him in a drink. They toast the king and drink confusion to the French. They discuss the ever-present danger of mutiny, which looms large in their minds after the recent uprisings at Spithead and the Nore. Vere, while admitting that there may have been legitimate grievances in the first instance, regards the Nore incident as an example of the spread of seditious French revolutionary ideas.\nStill influenced by Billy Budd's farewell to \"the old Right o' Man, \" the two officers consider him a potential danger, but Vere assures them that this was simply high spirits. He listens with satisfaction to the men singing below decks. The second Lieutanant reports that Cape Finisterre has been sighted; the ship is now in enemy waters.\nSCENE 3: The berth-deck\nThe men off watch are singing shanties. When Dansker expresses the wish for a plug of tobacco, Billy offers to get him one and discovers Squeak interfering with his kit. They struggle and Squeak draws a knife, but is soon felled by Billy. When Squeak tries to claim Claggart's protection, he is put in irons and gagged. Claggart commends Billy: \"Handsomely done my lad. And handsome is as handsome did it, too.\" But he lashes out at a boy who stumbles against him, and reveals in a soliloquy his hatred of Billy because of his handsomeness and goodness, vowing to destroy this being who shines such light into the darkness of his own natural depravity.\nSqueak having failed him, he browbeats the Novice into trying to suborn Billy into mutiny with two gold guineas. The Novice's fear of further punishment gets the better of his reluctacne to betray Billy. The Novice approaches the sleeping Billy, begging him to be the leader of a supposed party of discontented impressed men, but Billy, stammering in his rage, drives him away. He tells Dansker what has happened, and the old sailor, identifying the source of the trouble, warns him that \"Jemmy Legs\" is down on him, but Billy declares that Claggart, like everyone else on board, likes him.\nACT II\nSCENE 1: The main-deck and quarter-deck, some days later\nThe ship is surrounded by mist as Claggart approaches Captain Vere to make a complaint about a danger to the ship. He is interrupted by the cry that a French ship has been sighted. The men, who have been impatiently waiting such a chance, prepare to chase it - Billy, Dansker, Red Whiskers and another sailor, Donald, volunteer for a boarding party - but it is too fast, and the crew subsides into grumbling. Claggart again approaches the impatient Vere, accusing Billy of mutiny and producing the two gold coins as evidence that he had been trying to recruit followers. Although sceptical, Vere has to question Billy and has him summoned quietly to his cabin.\nSCENE 2: The Captain's cabin, a few minutes later\nBilly, having heard rumors that he is to be promoted, is all eagerness, begging to be allowed to be the Captain's coxswain. Vere, though even more convinced of Billy's innocence and suspicious of Claggart, is obliged to confront Billy with his accuser.\nWhen Claggart accuses Billy of mutiny, he is struck by his stammer and, in frustration at his inability to answer, strikes Claggart on the forehead and he falls dead.\nVere calls a drum-head court-martial, presided over by his officers (he has to be a witness). Billy answers that he is loyal to his king and ship, but has to admit striking Claggart. He begs Vere to save him, and is sent out as the court deliberates. The officers ask Vere for counsel, but he is unable to help them and reluctantly they sentence Billy to hang from the yard-arm at dawn. Vere, fully aware of the anomaly of having to execute a good man for the inadvertent killing of an evil one, goes to break the news to him.\nSCENE 3: A bay of the gun-deck before dawn\nIn irons, Billy prepares tranquilly for his fate. Dansker brings him food and drink and advises that the men are prepared to mutiny on his account, but Billy warns that they will hang without saving him. Billy reflects that fate had ordained his killing of Claggart and his own death.\nSCENE 4: The main-deck and quarter-deck, four o'clock in the morning\nThe first Lieutenant reads the Articles of War, by which Billy has been condemned, and the sentence. Billy calls out \"Starry Vere, God bless you!\" echoed by the crew. As he is hanged, a murmur arises among the men, but they disperse when ordered.\nEPILOGUE\nVere\nYears later, Vere reflects that he could have saved Billy, whose goodness he feels has in some way blessed him."},{"opera_title":"I Capuleti ed i Montecchi","composer":"Vincenzo Bellini","synopsis":"The Capulets and the Montagues\nACT I\nCapello, the chief of the Capuleti, refuses to agree to a pact through which his daughter Giulietta would marry Romeo of the Montecchi clan, and orders that her marriage to Tebaldo should go ahead immediately.

A winter's night in the palace of Count Vladimir Andrejevich\nPrincess Fedora, who is to marry the Count the following day, arrives and sings of her love for him, unaware that the dissolute Count has betrayed her with another woman. The sound of sleigh-bells is heard, and the Count is brought in mortally wounded. Doctors and a priest are summoned, and the servants are questioned. It is proposed that Count Loris Ipanov, a suspected Nihilist sympathizer, was probably the assassin. De Siriex (a diplomat), and Grech (a police inspector) plan an investigation. Fedora swears on the jeweled Byzantine cross she is wearing that Count Andrejevich's death will be avenged.\n Act 2\nParis\nFedora has followed Loris Ipanov there to avenge her fianc\u00e9's death. There is a reception at Fedora's house. A virtuoso pianist is playing for the party-goers. Ipanov arrives and declares his love for Fedora. She tells him that she is returning to Russia the following day. Loris is desperate because he has been exiled from Russia and cannot follow her. He confesses to Fedora that it was he who had killed Count Vladimir. Fedora asks him to return after the reception is over to tell her the whole story. When she is alone, Fedora writes a letter to the chief of the Imperial Police in Russia accusing Ipanov of Count Vladimir's murder. Loris returns and confesses that he killed Count Vladimir because he had discovered that he and his wife were lovers. The night of the homicide, Ipanov had discovered them together.

Fedora dies in Loris's arms."},{"opera_title":"Rienzi","composer":"Richard Wagner","synopsis":"Overture\nThe opera opens with a substantial overture which begins with a trumpet call (which in Act 3 we learn is the war call of the Colonna family) and features the melody of Rienzi's prayer at the start of Act 5, which became the opera's best-known aria. The overture ends with a dazzling military march.\n Act 1\nOutside Rienzi's house\nThe patrician Orsini and his cronies attempt to kidnap Rienzi's sister Irene. Stefano Colonna, also a patrician but inclined to support Rienzi, prevents them. Raimondo appeals to the parties in the name of the Church to stop their fighting; Rienzi's eventual appearance (marked by a dramatic key shift, from D to E flat) quells the riot. The Roman people support Rienzi's condemnation of the nobles. Irene and Adriano realise their mutual attraction (duet Ja, eine Welt voll Leiden (Yes, a world of sorrows)). A gathering crowd of plebeians, inspired by Rienzi's speeches, offers Rienzi the crown; he demurs, insisting that he wishes only to be a Tribune of the Roman people.\n Act 2\nA hall in the Capitol\nThe patricians plot the death of Rienzi; Adriano is horrified when he learns of this. Rienzi greets a group of ambassadors for whom an entertainment (a lengthy ballet) is laid on. Orsini attempts to stab Rienzi, who however is protected by a vest of chain-mail. Adriano pleads with Rienzi for mercy to the nobles, which Rienzi grants.\nThe Act 2 ballet is noteworthy as Wagner made a clear attempt to make it relevant to the action of the opera (whereas in most Grand Operas the ballet was simply an entertaining diversion). The Rienzi ballet was intended to tell the tale of the 'Rape of Lucretia'. This storyline (in which Tarquinius, the last king of Rome, attempts to rape the virtuous Lucretia), parallels both the action of Rienzi (Orsini's attempt on Irene) and its background (patricians versus the people). In its original form the ballet lasts for over half an hour - in modern performances and recordings it is generally drastically cut.\n Act 3\nThe Roman Forum\nThe patricians have recruited an army to march on Rome. The people are alarmed. Rienzi rouses the people and leads them to victory over the nobles, in the course of which Adriano's father Stefano is killed. Adriano swears revenge, but Rienzi dismisses him.\n Act 4\nBefore the Lateran Church\nCecco and other citizens discuss the negotiations of the patricians with the Pope and with the Emperor of Germany. Adriano's intention to kill Rienzi wavers when Rienzi arrives together with Irene. Raimondo now announces that the Pope has laid a papal ban on Rienzi, and that his associates risk excommunication. Despite Adriano's urgings, Irene resolves to stay with Rienzi.\n Act 5\nScene 1: A room in the Capitol\nRienzi in his prayer Allm\u00e4cht'ger Vater (Almighty Father!) asserts his faith in the people of Rome. He suggests to Irene that she seeks safety with Adriano, but she demurs. An apologetic Adriano enters and tells the pair that the Capitol is to be burnt and they are at risk. (Sound clip:Rienzi's prayer sung by Max Lorenz, 1941)\nScene 2: The Capitol is ablaze\nRienzi's attempts to speak are met with stones and insults from the fickle crowd. Adriano, in trying to rescue Rienzi and Irene, is killed with them as the building collapses.\nIn the original performances, Rienzi's final words are bitter and pessimistic: \"May the town be accursed and destroyed! Disintegrate and wither, Rome! Your degenerate people wish it so.\" However for the 1847 Berlin performance Wagner substituted a more upbeat rhetoric: \"Ever while the seven hills of Rome remain, ever while the eternal city stands, you will see Rienzi's return!\"."},{"opera_title":"Der Wildsch\u00fctz","composer":"Gustav Albert Lortzing","synopsis":"The Poacher\nACT I\n\tThe ageing Baculus has accidentally shot a deer belonging to Count Eberbach, for whom he works as a schoolmaster.\n\tWhen he is summoned to account for his actions, his fianc\u00e9e Gretchen offers to intercede, but Baculus is reluctant to let her near the lecherous count.

The count arrives in a hunting party with his friend the baron. He is so taken by \"Gretchen\" that he invites her and her friends to his birthday celebrations the next day.\nACT II\n\tAt the castle, the countess gets into a misunderstanding with the baron, not realizing that he is her brother whom she too has not seen since childhood.

The baron then offers Baculus 5000 thalers if he will give up his bride, an offer he agrees to in the belief that the baron is referring to the \"real\" Gretchen.\nACT III\n\tBaculus tries to persuade Gretchen to go along with the baron's offer, only to discover that the baron is interested in the counterfeit Gretchen. The baron is furious when the plot is revealed, but all is resolved when the \"student\" reveals that he\/she is none other than Baroness Freimann.

Suddenly Zamoro, an Inca, appears and asks them to release the man; they do so.\nZamoro tells the Indians that he had been captured and tortured by Gusmano, the leader of the Spaniards (Un Inca, eccesso orribile \/ \"An Inca..dreadful outrage!\") to the point where everyone believed him to be dead. Otumbo tells Zamoro that Alzira, his beloved, along with her father Ataliba, are being held captive by the Spaniards, and he urges the Indian tribes to revolt: Risorto fra le tenebre \/ \"I emerged into the darkness...\").\n Act 1: A Life for a Life\nScene 1: The main square of Lima\nAlvaro announces that, due to his age and infirmity, he is relinquishing the governorship and handing it over to his son, Gusmano who states that his first act will be to secure peace with the Incas.

She recounts a more disturbing dream she has had of Gusmano (Da Gusman sul fragil barca \/ \"I was fleeing from Gusman in a frail boat\") but, although he is dead, she still believes that Zamoro loves her: Nell'astro che pi\u00f9 fulgido \/ \"On the star that gleams most brightly...there lives Zamoro\". Ataliba continues to try to persuade Alzira to marry Gusmano, without success, until suddenly Zamoro enters. Believing that it is his ghost, Alzira is skeptical, but realizes that he is still alive. They pledge their love together: Risorge ne'tuoi lumi l'astro de'giorni miei! \/ \"The star of my existence has risen again in your eyes!\".\nGusmano enters, sees the couple together, and orders that Zamoro be arrested and immediately executed. As the Inca invasion of Lima is announced, Alvaro confirms that Zamoro has saved him from certain death; Gusmano orders him to be freed to go out to fight with the invading Incas: \"I shall meet you in battle, hated rival\".\n Act 2: The Vengeance of a Savage\nScene 1: The fortifications of Lima\nZamoro has led a fresh attack against the conquistadores and has been captured.

All of the eligible young men are hopeful of a union with Rose Maybud, the prettiest maiden in the village, yet they are too timid to approach her. The desperate bridesmaids ask Rose's aunt, Dame Hannah, if she would consider marrying, but she has vowed to remain eternally single. Many years previously, she had been betrothed to \"a god-like youth\" who turned out to be Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, one of the bad baronets of Ruddigore. Only on her wedding day had she discovered his true identity.\nRobin's weak crimes stir his ancestral ghosts from their usual haunt of the castle's portrait gallery. The curse requires them to ensure that their successors are duly committing a crime every day, and to torture them to death if they fail. They inquire as to Robin's compliance with this requirement. They are not pleased to learn that the newly-recognised baronet's crimes range from the ridiculous (forging his own will) to the ubiquitous (filing a false income tax return \"Nothing at all\", say the ghosts, \"Everybody does that. It's expected of you.\") Robin's uncle, the late Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, orders him to \"carry off a lady\" that day or perish in horrible agony. After the ghosts treat him to a sample of the agonies he would face, Robin reluctantly agrees. He tells Adam to go to the village and abduct a lady - \"Any lady!\"\nDespard has atoned for his previous ten years of evil acts and has married Mad Margaret. The two of them now live a life of moderately-paid public service. They come to the castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime. When Robin asserts that he has done no wrong yet, they remind him that he is morally responsible for all the crimes Despard had done in his stead. Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.\nMeanwhile, Adam has complied with Robin's orders but has unfortunately chosen to abduct Dame Hannah. The dame proves formidable indeed, and Robin cries out for his uncle's protection. Sir Roderic duly appears, recognises his former love, and, angered that his former fianc\u00e9e has been abducted, dismisses Robin. Left alone, he and Dame Hannah enjoy a brief reunion. Robin interrupts them, accompanied by Rose, Richard, and the bridesmaids. He quibbles that, under the terms of the curse, a Baronet of Ruddigore can die only by refusing to commit a daily crime. Refusing is therefore \"tantamount to suicide\", but suicide is, itself, a crime. Thus, he reasons, his predecessors \"ought never to have died at all.\"* Roderic follows this logic and agrees, stating that he is \"practically\" alive.\nNow that Robin is free of the curse, Rose once again drops Richard and happily resumes her engagement to Robin.

Valens, the governor of Antioch (occupied by the Romans) issues a decree that in honour of Diocletian's birthday all citizens will offer sacrifice to Roman goddesses Venus and Flora on pain of punishment, and puts Septimius in charge of enforcing this.\nDidymus, a soldier asks that citizens whose consciences prevent this be spared punishment, which Valens dismisses. Septimius suspects Didymus is a Christian and affirms his own loyalty to the rule but would also like to be tolerant of others.\nIn the Christian community, Theodora (a princess) and her friend Irene are worshipping when a messenger brings news of Valens' decree. Irene prevents them dispersing and they reaffirm their faith. Theodora speaks out when Septimius comes to arrest them - Theodora is not punished by death (an option she would prefer to her actual punishment of enforced prostitution) and is led away. Irene informs Didymus who goes in the hope of either rescuing her or dying with her. The first Act closes with a chorus of Christians praying for the mission's success.\nAt the start of the second Act the festival is in full swing. Valens sends Septimius to tell Theodora that if she doesn't join in with the festival by the end of the day, he will send soldiers to rape her, which excites the soldiers. Theodora is frightened in the brothel, but her mood changes in contemplation of the after life. By persuading Septimius of his Christianity and also love for Theodora, Didymus gets access to her cell with his helmet concealing his identity, offering an escape. Fearing threats to her integrity and wishing to stay true to her faith, Theodora asks Didymus to kill her but he convinces her that God will save them. He gives her his uniform, and thus disguised, Theodora escapes, leaving Didymus in her place.\nAs the third part opens the Christians celebrate Theodora's safe return. However she is guilty that she endangered Didymus's life to do this. A messenger informs them Didymus has been captured and Valens has changed her punishment to death. Irene protests, but Theodora goes to offer herself in Didymus' place. As Valens sentences Didymus, Theodora enters demanding that she die and Didymus be saved. Both Didymus and Theodora argue that they should die in place of the other. Septimius is moved by this, and pleads for clemency. Valens, however, condemns both to death and they sing a duet to their immortality."},{"opera_title":"Turn of the screw","composer":"Benjamin Britten","synopsis":"The action takes place at Bly, a country house, about the middle of the last century.\nPROLOGUE\nThe narrator describes the circumstances surrounding the engagement of a young governess to a new post in a country house.\nMoved by the persuasion of the young and handsome uncle of two orphan children, their guardian, she accepts the appointment and the conditions that she is not to worry him at any time.\nACT I\nSCENE 1: The Journey\nAs she travels to Bly, the governess wonders about what the future will hold.\nSCENE 2: The Welcome\nMiles and Flora excitedly await the governess' arrival, with Mrs Grose, the housekeeper.

Public Opinion explains who she is - the guardian of morality (\"Qui suis-je? du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antique\"). She seeks to rework the story of Orph\u00e9e (Orpheus) and Eurydice - who, despite being husband and wife, hate each other - into a moral tale for the ages. However, she has her work cut out for her: Eurydice is in love with the shepherd, Arist\u00e9e (Aristaeus), who lives next door (\"La femme dont le coeur r\u00eave\"), and Orph\u00e9e is in love with Chlo\u00eb, a shepherdess. When Orph\u00e9e mistakes Eurydice for her, everything comes out, and Eurydice insists they break the marriage off. However Orph\u00e9e, fearing Public Opinion's reaction, torments her into keeping the scandal quiet using violin music, which she hates.\nWe now meet Arist\u00e9e - who is, in fact, Pluton (Pluto) - keeping up his disguise by singing a pastoral song about those awful sheep (\"Moi, je suis Arist\u00e9e\"). Since Pluton was originally played by a famous female impersonator, this song contains numerous falsetto notes. Eurydice, however, has discovered what she thinks is a plot by Orph\u00e9e to kill Arist\u00e9e, but is in fact a conspiracy between him and Pluton to kill her, so Pluton may have her. Pluton tricks her into walking into the trap by showing immunity to it, and, as she dies, transforms into his true form (Transformation Scene) Eurydice finds that death is not so bad when the God of Death is in love with you (\"La mort m'appara\u00eet souriante\"), and so keeps coming back for one more verse. They descend into the Underworld as soon as Eurydice has left a note telling her husband she has been unavoidably detained (Descent to the Underworld).\nAll seems to be going well for Orph\u00e9e until Public Opinion catches up with him, and threatens to ruin his violin teaching career unless he goes to rescue his wife. Orph\u00e9e reluctantly agrees.\nScene 2:\nOlympus\nThe scene changes to Olympus, where the Gods sleep out of boredom (\"Dormons, dormons\"). Things look a bit more interesting for them when Diane (Diana) returns and begins gossiping about Actaeon, her current love (\"Quand Diane descend dans la plaine\"). However, Jupiter, shocked at the behaviour of the supposedly virgin goddess, has turned Actaeon into a stag. Pluton then arrives, and reveals to the other gods the pleasures of Hell, leading them to revolt against horrid ambrosia, hideous nectar, and the sheer boredom of Olympus (\"Aux armes, dieux et demi-dieux!\"). Jupiter's demands to know what is going on lead them to point out his hypocrisy at great length, describing - and poking fun of - all his mythological affairs. However, little further progress can be made before news of Orph\u00e9e's arrival forces the gods to get onto their best behaviour. Pluton is worried he will be forced to give Eurydice back, and, after a quotation from Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice sends the gods to tears, Jupiter announces that he is going to Hell to sort everything out. The other gods beg to come with him, he consents, and mass celebration breaks out at this holiday (\"Gloire! gloire \u00e0 Jupiter\").\nACT TWO\nScene 1\nEurydice is being kept locked up by Pluto, and is finding life very dull. Her gaoler, a dull-witted tippler by the name of John Styx, is not helping, particularly his habit of telling, at the slightest provocation, all about how he was King of the Beotians until he died. But if he had not died, he would still be king (\"Quand j'\u00e9tais roi de B\u00e9otie\").\nJupiter spots where Pluton hid Eurydice whilst being shown around by him, and slips through the keyhole by turning into a beautiful, golden fly. He meets Eurydice on the other side, and sings a love duet with her where his part consists entirely of buzzing (\"Bel insecte \u00e0 l'aile dor\u00e9e\"). Afterwards, he reveals himself to her, and promises to help her, largely because he wants her for himself.\nScene 2\nThe scene shifts to a huge party the gods are having in Hell, where ambrosia, nectar, and propriety are nowhere to be seen (\"Vive le vin! Vive Pluton!\"). Eurydice sneaks in disguised as a bacchante (\"J'ai vu le dieu Bacchus\"), but Jupiter's plan to sneak her out is interrupted by calls for a dance. Unfortunately, Jupiter can only dance minuets which everyone else finds boring and awful (\"La la la. Le menuet n'est vraiment si charmant\"). Things liven up, though, as the most famous number in the operetta, the Galop Infernal (best known as the music of the Can-can) starts, and everyone throws himself into it with wild abandon (\"Ce bal est original\").\nOminous violin music heralds the approach of Orph\u00e9e (Entrance of Orph\u00e9e and Public Opinion), but Jupiter has a plan, and promises to keep Eurydice away from him. As with the standard myth, Orph\u00e9e must not look back, or he'll lose Eurydice forever (\"Ne regarde pas en arri\u00e8re!\"). Public Opinion keeps a close eye on him, to keep him from cheating, but Jupiter throws a lightning bolt, making him jump and look back, and so all ends happily, with a reprise of the Galop."},{"opera_title":"Arabella","composer":"Richard Strauss","synopsis":"ACT I\n\tVienna, 1860s.

As the girl waltzes through the room, she does not notice Matteo, who pleads desperately with Zdenka for some sign of Arabella's professed love. Zdenka presses a key into his hand, telling him it is from Arabella and unlocks the latter's bedroom. Mandryka, overhearing, is appalled. Furious, he drinks recklessly and flirts with Fiakermilli and the Countess until Waldner brings him to his senses by suggesting they return to the hotel.\nACT III\n\tUnaware that Matteo has spent an hour in her room upstairs, Arabella returns from the ball, softly repeating to herself Mandryka's description of his country home. Matteo, trying to leave unnoticed, is amazed to find Arabella in the lobby and cannot understand her cool cordiality, since he believes her to have been in his arms shortly before. Mandryka arrives with the Waldners and, thinking Arabella faithless, provokes Waldner to demand satisfaction. A duel is averted when Zdenka runs downstairs in flowing negligee, confessing she gave herself to Matteo to avert his suicide. Overcome with shame, she threatens suicide herself but is forgiven by her parents and embraced by Matteo. As the others go to their quarters, Arabella bids Mandryka send his servant to her room with a glass of water. He does so and stands in the lobby, wondering how she feels toward him now.

Fernando rushes to the court to save his daughter's life, but is too late; he too is sent to prison, while she is condemned to death.\nErnesto, a military friend of Fernando bursts in looking for the Mayor, and holding a royal pardon for Ninetta's father. Pippo shows him the way and is given a silver coin for helping, but the magpie snatches it and flies up to the tower. Pippo and Antonio pursue the thief.\nNinetta is taken to the scaffold, and makes her final speech to the crowd. From the tower, Pippo and Antonio cry out that they've found Lucia's silver in the magpie's nest and they ring the bells. The crowd hear their words and hope to save Ninetta, but shots ring out and they conclude they are too late. However, Ninetta appears walking down the hill - the shots were mere rejoicing. Ninetta celebrates with her companions but is worried about her father. He then appears with Ernesto and all - except the Mayor - enjoy a happy ending.\n Arias\nThe most famous aria in the opera is probably Ninetta's prayer \"Deh, tu reggi in tal momento\". The soprano cavatina \"Di piacer mi balza cor\" and the tenor cavatina \"Vieni fra queste braccia\" (the cabaletta for the duet between Arturo and Elvira from Bellini's I Puritani starts with exactly the same words) are two examples of Rossini's brilliant vocal writing."},{"opera_title":"Orlando furioso","composer":"Antonio Vivaldi","synopsis":"Act 1.\nIn a delightful garden in which two springs are seen, Medoro escapes from a shipwreck into the arms of his beloved Angelica.

These two gondoliers are so gallant and peerless in their manly beauty that the maidens are waiting for them to select brides before they can consider other suitors. The male chorus of merry gondoliers enters, saying that they adore the young ladies, but the ladies explain that the two brothers must choose first. When the Palmieri brothers enter, the ladies present them with flowers. The two gondoliers amiably offer to pick their two brides in a game of blind man's buff. \"As all are young and fair, and amiable besides\", they feel it would be unfair to show any favouritism.

Because of the quarrel, they have neglected their duties, and nature is in disarray.

The couple spent two years galavanting around until Alexei was compelled by his father to return. His father was paranoid that Alexei was conspiring against him and ultimately Alexei ended up being imprisoned and tortured. The Russian senate convicted him of conspiring against his father and he was sentenced to death. He died due to ill health before he could be executed, most likely resulting from the poor treatment he received while imprisoned.\n\tReichert's libretto differs on several points from the life of Alexei. First, he changed the story so that the young girl, Sonja, is first seen disguised as a male Circassian dancer. When the Tsarevich runs away with Sonja he believes that she is a boy adding what Richard Traubner of Opera News called an \"underlying homosexual frisson\" to the operetta. Eventually the young prince discovers that Sonja is in fact a girl disguised as a boy. The two fall in love and escape to Naples. A further major difference is that the operetta does not have such a tragic ending, though it is not exactly happy either. Eventually the Zarewitsch learns that his father has died and he knows his relationship can not continue with Sonja as he is now the Tsar.

The nuns remark on how fear now rules the country, and no one has the courage to stand up for the priests. Sister Constance asks, \"Are there no men left to come to the aid of the country?\" \"When priests are lacking, martyrs are superabundant,\" replies the new Mother Superior. Mother Marie says that the Carmelites can save France by giving their lives, but the Mother Superior corrects her: it is not permitted to become a martyr voluntarily, martyrdom is a gift from God.\n\tA police officer arrives and announces to the community that the Legislative Assembly has nationalized the monastery and its property, and the nuns must give up their religious habits. When Mother Marie acquiesces, the officer taunts her for being eager to dress like everyone else. She replies that the nuns will continue to serve, no matter how they are dressed. \"The people has no need of servants,\" proclaims the officer haughtily. \"No, but it has a great need for martyrs,\" responds Mother Marie. \"In times like these, death is nothing,\" he says. \"Life is nothing,\" she answers, \"when it is so debased.\"\n\tAct 3\n\tIn the absence of a new prioress, Mother Marie proposes that the nuns take a vow of martyrdom. However, all must agree, or Mother Marie will not insist. A secret vote is held; there is one dissenting voice. Sister Constance declares that she was the dissenter, and that she has changed her mind, so the vow can proceed. Blanche runs away from the monastery, and Mother Marie goes to look for her, finding her in her father's library. Her father has been guillotined, and Blanche has been forced to serve her former servants.\n\tThe nuns are all arrested and condemned to death, but Mother Marie is away (with Blanche, presumably) at the time. The chaplain tells Mother Marie that since God has chosen to spare her, she cannot now voluntarily become a martyr by joining the others in prison. The nuns (one by one) slowly mount the scaffold, singing the Veni Creator Spiritus. At the last minute, Blanche appears, to Constance's joy. Having seen all the other nuns executed, as she mounts the scaffold Blanche concludes their hymn with Deo patri sit gloria (Glory be to God the Father)."},{"opera_title":"The Queen of Spades","composer":"Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky","synopsis":"ACT I\nScene 1: The Summer Garden in St Petersburg in the time of Catherine II (late 18th century)\nIt is a fine spring day and everyone is promenading in the park: nannies, governesses, children, soldiers. Among these are Surin and Chekalinsky, who discuss the strange behavior of their colleague Hermann, who spent the previous night watching the play at the gaming tables without joining in.\nHermann himself and his friend Count Tomsky appear and Hermann reveals the reason for his recent strange gloomy mood: he is in love - passionately and hopelessly, since he is poor and the object of his love is noble and consequently out of his reach. He rejects Tomsky's cheerful suggestion that another will do just as well. They are interrupted by a group of promenaders - the young rejoicing in the spring weather, the old lamenting the passing of the good old days. Hermann reveals that he has some hope that his love is returned, but if he is wrong his only refuge is death.\nPrince Yeletsky appears. He has just become engaged and is congratulated by the others, except for Hermann, who is sunk in gloom. The Countess and her granddaughter Lisa appear and Yeletsky reveals that Lisa is his betrothed. Both Lisa and the Countess are disturbed by the intensity of Hermann's eyes and he in turn is disturbed by the sight of the Countess.\nYeletsky, who has noticed Lisa's agitation, joins her and the Countess. They stroll away while Yeletsky tells his friends the story of the Countess, who had gained the nickname of the Queen of Spades in her youth because of her passion for gambling. Once, when she was desperate and had lost all her money, an admirer gave her a secret by which she was able to recoup all her losses - by playing three special cards. She later told her secret to her husband and a handsome young man, but then received a warning from an apparition that she would receive her death blow from the third man who \"impelled by burning passion,\" tried to wrench the secret from her.\nSurin and Chekalinsky tease Hermann, suggesting that this might be the way for him to win without risking any money. A storm has blown up and the promenaders disperse, except for Hermann who broods over Tomsky's story and the sinister figure of the old woman, though he is still more preoccupied by his passion for Lisa. He swears that she will be his, despite the prince.\nScene 2: Lisa's room\nLisa and her friends are playing the harpsichord and singing. Her best friend Pauline sings a melancholy song; then, reproaching herself for being so inappropriate on a happy day, leads the others in a jolly Russian country dance and song, to the disapproval of the governess - such behavior is not suitable for well brought-up young ladies.\nThe girls go, leaving Lisa to brood over the fact the although Yeletsky has all the qualities desirable in a husband, she is not happy. She cannot forget Hermann's fiery gaze, \"like a fallen angel.\"\nHe suddenly appears at the door to her balcony and declares his passion, asking only to gaze at her for the last time before leaving forever. She is moved, but begs him to go. He has to hide when the Countess, disturbed by the noise, comes up to see what is happening. Lisa tells her she is restless and unable to sleep. The Countess leaves and Lisa admits to Hermann that she loves him.\nACT II\nScene 1: A fancy-dress ball\nHermann's friends suspect that he is obsessed by the story of the three cards and resolve to tease him. They do this throughout the scene by appearing behind him and whispering, so that he is not sure whether he is awake or dreaming.\nLisa tries to avoid Yeletsky, but he assures her of his unselfish devotion. She has written a note to Hermann, promising to meet him at the ball. A pastoral masque takes place to entertain the guests. Lisa gives Hermann an assignation for the next night, explaining how he can reach the room by going through that of the Countess. He says it must be tonight and she agress. The empress arrives at the ball.\nScene 2: The Countess' bedroom, later that night\nHermann feels that fate has intervened by allowing him into the old woman's bedroom. He feels that a strange destiny links his life with hers and determines to try and get the secret from her. His obsession about the three cards is beginning to overpower his love for Lisa and he gazes at the portrait of the once-famous beauty with passionate intensity.\nHe hides as the Countess and Lisa come in. Lisa goes to her room while the Countess prepares for bed. She reclines on a couch, remembering her youth. She dozes and wakes to find Hermann standing beside her. He begins by asking her calmly for the secret, trying not to frighten her, but as she gazes at him in terrified silence he becomes violent, and finally threatens her with a revolver.\nShe dies of fright and Lisa, hearing the noise, comes in to find Hermann lamenting that the old lady had died without revealing her secret. Accusing him of having come for this reason and not for love of her she sends him away.\nACT III\nScene 1: Hermann's room in the barracks\nHermann reads a letter from Lisa in which she absolves him for the death of the Countess and begs him to meet her on the embankment of the river.\nHe broods over the old woman's funeral and his illusion that the body had winked at him. The ghost of the Countess appears, against her will, and tells him the three cards: three, seven and ace.\nScene 2: The embankment at midnight\nLisa waits, full of anguish. Although she tries to believe Herman innocent, she fears the worst and feels that she too is marked by the curse on a murderer. If he does not come by midnight, she will know that all is over.\nHe appears on the last stroke of the bell and she greets him joyfully. He responds in the same vein. She promises to follow him to the ends of the earth, but he insists on going to the gaming tables to win a fortune. She is horrified and as his obsession with gambling takes over he reveals callously that he had been responsible for the old woman's death while trying to get her secret from her and that he now knows the secret. He spurns Lisa and she throws herself into the river.\nScene 3: The gambling rooms\nThe officers are gambling and making merry. Yeletsky joins them, hoping to find Hermann and be revenged for his broken engagement. Hermann appears and begins to play, waging large sums on the turn of one card. He wins with the promised three and seven, but when Yeletsky takes the last hand against him, instead of the expected ace he turns up the Queen of Spades, the ghost of the Countess.\nDriven to madness, he stabs himself. He lives just long enough to regain some sanity and beg Yeletsky's pardon - and to remember his love for Lisa, hoping that she too will forgive him."},{"opera_title":"Euryanthe","composer":"Carl Maria von Weber","synopsis":"Time: 1110Place: Pr\u00e9mery and Nevers, France\n Act 1\nEuryanthe is betrothed to Count Adolar. In a hall of the palace of King Louis of France in Pr\u00e9mery, the count sings the praises of his promised bride. Lysiart, Count of Forest and Beaujolais, challenges the fidelity of the maiden and asserts that he can win her should he care to try. Adolar stakes his lands and fortune on the faithfulness of Euryanthe and demands that his friend shall show some proof of his victory should he win one.\nIn her castle at Nevers, Euryanthe has given refuge to Eglantine de Puiset, the daughter of a mutineer. Eglantine is enamoured of Adolar, and under the pretence of friendship for her benefactor, she secretly determines to effect Euryanthe's downfall and rupture her attachment to Adolar. Lysiart, who has unsuccessfully attempted to gain the favor of Euryanthe, assists Eglantine. After questioning by Eglantine, Euryanthe confides a secret given to her by Adolar to Eglantine. The latter's sister Emma had lost her lover in battle, and had killed herself by drinking poison from a ring (the 'ghost' music from the overture is heard). Her soul can find no rest until the ring, lying in her tomb, should be moistened with the tears of an injured and innocent maiden. Euryanthe, who has been praying each night at Emma's tomb, had promised Adolar to keep this secret, and, too late, she repents having told it to Eglantine. After Euryanthe leaves, Eglantine sings how she will denounce Euryanthe to Adolar; Lysiart arrives in order to take Euryanthe to the palace.\n Act 2\nAt night, Lysiart sings both of his guilt and his love. Eglantine visits the tomb, abstracts the ring, and gives it to Lysiart, who had almost given up on his wager with Adolar. She lets him know the secret behind the ring, and he proposes marriage with Eglantine.\nBefore an assembly in the hall at Pr\u00e9mery, Adolar reveals his anxiety while still longing for his bride, who then arrives. Lysiart displays the jewel to Count Adolar, claiming that Euryanthe had told him about it. Adolar is convinced that his betrothed is unfaithful, since she must have betrayed the secret known to him and her alone. Euryanthe protests her innocence, Adolar gives up his possessions to Lysiart, and rushes off into the forest with Euryanthe.\n Act 3\nIn a rocky gorge, Adolar intends to kill Euryanthe, still protesting her innocence, and then himself. They are suddenly attacked by a serpent and the girl throws herself between her lover and the monster; Adolar kills the serpent. He cannot find the heart to kill the one who would have given her life for his, and he goes off, leaving her to her fate. Euryanthe longs for death, but the king and his hunters arrive on the scene, and she recounts the story of her woe and the treachery of Eglantine. Although joyful that she might see Adolar again, she collapses as they lead her away.\nMeanwhile, Eglantine has become engaged to Lysiart, and the wedding is about to take place in the Castle of Nevers, when she is stricken with remorse. Adolar has entered in black armour with his visor down. Eglantine, struck by the silence of the courtiers, and still in love with Adolar, thinks that Euryanthe appears to her as a ghost. Adolar shows who he is, and challenges Lysiart to fight. The king appears, and to punish Adolar for his distrust of Euryanthe, tells him that she is dead. Eglantine, triumphant at the supposed death of her rival, makes known the plot and is slain by the furious Lysiart. As Eglantine dies Euryanthe enters and rushes to Adolar. Lysiart is led off, and Adolar's sister finds peace at last because her ring was moistened by the tears of the innocent Euryanthe."},{"opera_title":"Peter Grimes","composer":"Benjamin Britten","synopsis":"PROLOGUE\nInside the Moot Hall\nAn inquest is conducted by the lawyer Mr Swallow into the death of Peter Grimes' apprentice. Swallow accepts Grimes's account of how the boy died at sea when they ran out of water, bringing in a verdict of \"accidental circumstances,\" but warns Grimes not to get another apprentice. Grimes protests that he must have an apprentice and complains that the people of the Borough will blame him, despite the verdict. The widowed schoolteacher Ellen Orford tries to comfort him and they leave together.\nACT I\nSCENE 1: A street by the sea; the Moot Hall and the Boar both visible\nThe people of the village are going about their business. Grimes comes back from fishing but no one is willing to give him a hand to pull his boat ashore until Captain Balstrode and Ned Keene help him. Keene tells Grimes that he has found another workhouse boy to be his apprentice, but Hobson the carter only agrees to pick up the boy when Ellen offers to go with him.\nMrs Sedley is anxious about her supply of laudanum and accepts with ill grace Keene's instructions to meet him in the Boar, where he will hand over the drug when Hobson brings it. A storm is rising and Bob Boles, who has turned Methodist, calls on all to repent.\nBalstrode asks why Grimes does not try his luck elsewhere, but, outcast though he is, he is too rooted to the Borough to leave. He intends to make money - the only thing the Borough understands - and then marry Ellen. He is too proud to take up Balstrode's suggestion that he marry her now. As the storm begins to rage he wonders if life holds any peace for him.\nSCENE 2: Inside the Boar\nThe raging storm is apparent every time someone opens the door. Mrs Sedley is ill at ease as she waits for her laudanum. Boles, who is drunk, accosts one of Auntie's \"Nieces,\" and has to be restrained by Balstrode, who enunciates the basic rule of pub conversation: \"We live and let live, and look, we keep our hands to ourselves.\"\nGrimes comes in and sits lost in contemplation, unaware of the hostile reaction of the company. When Boles starts to harangue Grimes, Balstrode calls for a song. Everyone strikes up a round, Old Joe has gone Fishing, but Peter, joining in with disjointed recollections of the death of his apprentice, thows it out of kilter.\nThe carter arrives with Ellen and the boy, cold and wet, and Grimes drags the boy away without even a warm drink, to the disapproval of everyone.\nACT II\nSCENE 1:  As Act I, Scene 1; a sunny Sunday morning, some weeks later\nThe church service proceeds as Ellen and the boy sit by the quay. He does not reply to her questions and she is horrified to discover a bruise on his neck. Grimes comes to take the boy fishing, brushing aside Ellen's request for his day of rest to be respected, and says that he got the bruise \"out of the hurly-burly.\" Unable to sway him, Ellen cries out: \"We have failed,\" and he strikes her, answering roughly: \"So be it! And God have mercy upon me!\"\nAs Peter and the boy leave, Auntie, Keene and Boles, who have been watching from various windows, approach Ellen, expressing little sympathy, on the grounds that she has brought it on herself. The service over, the church-goers join in, ignoring Balstrode's protests.\nEllen explains how she and Peter had planned for a new life and how she had ried to care for the apprentice, but feeling against Grimes mounts. At the rector's suggestion a vigilante party sets off, to the accompaniment of a drum, to visit Grimes in his hut.\nSCENE 2: Grimes' hut\nGrimes, rough but not brutal, orders the boy to take off his Sunday clothes and get ready for fishing. He still clings, though less hopefully, to his dream of catching enough fish to become rich , marry Ellen and silence the gossips.\nHearing the approaching procession he accuses the boy of telling tales, and orders him to climb down the cliff at the back of the hut, their usual way to the boat. Despite Grimes' warning to be careful, as the storm had washed away some of the cliff, the boy falls with a cry. Grimes follows quickly and the people find the hut empty, but tidy. Swallow urges less interference in people's private lives.\nACT III\nSCENE 1. As in Act I, Scene 1; a summer evening\nThere is a dance in the Moot Hall and the Boar is also doing good business. Somewhat the worse for drink, Swallow makes a pass at one of the Nieces, while Keene chases the other. They escape and Mrs Sedley accosts Keene, accusing Grimes of murdering his apprentice, as neither has been seen for some days.\nHe does not believe her, saying that her wits are addled by laudanum, so she hides near a boat and overhears a converstion between Ellen and Balstrode, who reports that Grimes's boat is back but there is no sign of the boy. Ellen shows him the boy's jersey which she has found washed up on the shore. Armed with this knowledge, Mrs Sedley renews her accusation, this time to Swallow, and a posse is organised to search for Grimes.\nSCENE 2: As in Scene 1; some hours later\nDemented, Grimes broods on the deaths of the apprentices and his blighted dreams. As the voices of the searchers are heard, he echoes their shouts of \"Peter Grimes.\" Ellen and Balstrode come to him and Balstrode advises him to take his boat out of sight of land and sink it. He helps Grimes push the boat out and leads Ellen away.\nEPILOGUE\nDawn breaks and the searchers return to the Borough, which resumes its daily round. The reported sight of a boat sinking far out to sea arouses little interest."},{"opera_title":"Ifigenia en Aulide","composer":"Christof von Gluck","synopsis":"Iphigenia on Aulis\nACT I\nReturning to Troy, the Greeks are stranded on Aulis (Aulide) by high winds.

Mrs. Peachum, overhearing her husband's blacklisting of unproductive thieves, protests regarding one of them, Bob Booty (the nickname of Robert Walpole). The Peachums discover that Polly, their daughter, has secretly married Macheath, the famous highwayman, who is Peachum's principal client. Upset to find out that he will no longer be able to use Polly in his business, Peachum and his wife ask how Polly will support such a husband \"in Gaming, Drinking and Whoring\". Nevertheless, they conclude that the match may make sense if the husband can be killed for his money. They leave to carry out this errand. However, Polly has hidden Macheath.\n\tMacheath goes to a tavern where he is surrounded by women of dubious virtue who, despite their class, compete in displaying perfect drawing-room manners, although the subject of their conversation is their success in picking pockets and shoplifting. Macheath discovers, too late, that two of them (Jenny Diver, Suky Tawdry) have contracted with Peachum to capture him, and he becomes a prisoner in Newgate prison. The prison is run by Peachum's associate, the corrupt jailer Lockit. His daughter, Lucy Lockit, has the opportunity to scold Macheath for having agreed to marry her and then broken this promise. She tells him that to see him tortured would give her pleasure. Macheath pacifies her, but Polly arrives and claims him as her husband. Macheath tells Lucy that Polly is crazy. Lucy helps Macheath to escape by stealing her father's keys.

Only one stands up for her, admiring her as a king's daughter and pitying the way she is treated, but she is forced inside by the overseer and beaten.\n\tWhen the courtyard is clear, Elektra invokes the shade of her father Agamemnon, murdered by his wife Klytmnestra and her lover Aegisth on his return from Troy. She calls on him to appear to her, promising that she, her sister Chrysothemis and their brother Orest will celebrate his funeral rites when his death has been avenged.\n\tChrysothemis comes to warn Elektra that Klytmnestra and Aegisth are planning to shut her away in a tower. Chrysothemis, less obsessed with revenge than Elektra, longs to escape the oppressive atmosphere of the palace and lead a normal life, marry and bear a child, even if only to a peasant.\n\tShe warns Elektra to avoid Klytmnestra, who has dreamed that her exiled son Orest is pursuing her to avenge his father, and is afraid, being most to be feared in that state. But Elektra decides to confront her mother and stands her ground as Chrysothemis runs away. Klytmnestra, supported by her confidante and trainbearer, without whose aid she seems scarcely able to support herself, at first abuses Elektra, but then, misreading Elektra's double-edged answers, sends away her attendants, ignoring their warnings that Elektra is baiting her. She asks if Elektra knows a remedy against bad dreams, believing that Elektra will tell her what form of sacrifice she must make. She does not understand when Elektra tells her that when the appropriate sacrifice has been made she will indeed dream no longer.\n\tPassing abruptly from the cryptic answer that the sacrifice must be made by someone who is a stranger yet part of the household, Elektra asks when Orest will be allowed to return from exile. Klytmnestra answers that he is weak in the head, but Elektra taunts her with being afraid of him and reveals that the blood which must flow is hers, describing in detail the vengeance Orest will take. Klytmnestra's terror is changed to exultation when the confidante comes form the palace and whispers to her. Elekara does not understand until Chrysothemis runs out crying that Orest is dead; two strangers, and old man and a young one, have brought the news. A servant rides out to tell Aegisth.\n\tElektra decides that the task of vengeance must now fall on her and Chrysothemis, but all her flattery of her sister's strength and her promise to prepare her marriage bed and serve her like a slave are not enough to sway her. Chryosthemis, who only wants to escape, runs away and Elektra calls a curse after her. Deciding to act alone, Elektra begins to dig up the axe with which Agamemnon was murdered and which she has preserved for the deed of vengeance.\n\tRealising that the young stranger is watching her, she reacts angrily, regretting that he should be alive while Orest is dead. He gradually realises who she is, but even when the servants fall at his feet, she does not realise that this is Orest until he tells her. Her ecstatic welcome is cut short by the tutor's warning that the noise will give them away. He tells Orest that Klytmnestra is alone in the palace, without a man to defend her.\n\tOrest goes inside and Elektra is distressed that she failed to give him the axe. Klytmnestra's shriek rings out and Elektra calls on Orest to strike again. Chrysothemis and the maids run out of the palace in confusion.\n\tThey run back inside in fear as Aegisth arrives. He is puzzled by Elektra's unaccustomed obsequious greeting and her offer to light his way indoors. He goes in and is killed by Orest. The women rush out again in confusion and there is fighting between Orest's followers and those remaining loyal to Aegisth, ending in the victory of the former. Chrysothemis calls to Elektra that Orest has returned and killed Aegisth.

They explain the events against which the action of the opera takes place.\nBy murder and treachery, the Etruscan Tarquinius Superbus has become King of Rome and rules in a reign of terror. His son Tarquinius Sextus leads a Roman army against the Greeks, to distract attention from conditions in Rome, \"and treats the proud city as if it were his whore.\"\nA curtain rises to reveal the army camp outside Rome with the generals' tent where Collatinus, Junius and Tarquinius are drinking. It is night. They discuss the events of the previous night when some of generals had ridden back to Rome to check up on their wives and found most of them unfaithful, including the wife of Junius. Collatinus tells them they were foolish to go and the others comment that he has no need to worry since his wife Lucretia was the only one found virtuously at home.\nTarquinius taunts Junius with the faithlessness of his wife and they quarrel acrimoniously. Collatinus calms them and Tarquinius proposes a toast to the chaste Lucretia. Junius bursts out of the tent, unable to bear the comparison between Lucretia and his wife. Male Chorus comments, remarking how lucky Collatinus is to have chosen a virtuous wife.\nCollatinus comes out and reproaches Junius for venting his rage against his own wife in bitterness against Lucretia and, and Junius apologises. When Tarquinius joins them and resumes his taunting of Junius, Collatinus reproves him and makes peace between the two. Satisfied with his work he retires to bed.\nTarquinius reveals his obsession with Lucretia, claiming that she is \"as chaste as she is beautiful\" and declaring that he will \"prove Lucretia chaste.\" Junius leaves him with an admonition that he will not dare. As Tarqunius paces up and down Male Chorus utters his thoughts:\nTarquinius does not dare,\u2028When Tarquinius does not desire;\u2028But I am Prince of Rome\u2028And Lucretia's eyes my Empire.\nTarquinius breaks in in his own voice calling for his horse.\nINTERLUDE\nMale Chrous relates Tarquinius' ride to Rome.\nSCENE 2: The hall of Lucretia's home\nLucretia, her nurse Bianca and her maid Lucia are sewing and spinning. Joined by Female Chorus, they sing of a woman's fate.\nLucretia starts up, thinking she hears a knock and hoping it might be a messenger from Collatinus - even though, as Bianca reminds her, she has already had two letters from him that day. But there was no one at the door. Lucretia laments her separation from her husband.\nIt is late and they begin folding linen while Female Chorus reflects on the lot of women. They prepare to go to bed while Male and Female Chorus alternate, she describing the sleeping city and he the approach of Tarquinius.\n(In the scene that follows they continue to describe what is happening while the characters mime the actions described, only occasionally uttering lines of their own.)\nTarquinius knocks at the door and is admitted. He claims hospitality, alleging his horse is lame. Lucretia is unable to refuse him but the two servants mutter suspiciously. Bianca in particular fears danger and resents his presence. They all bid one another good night and depart for bed.\nACT II\nSCENE 1\nMale and Female Chorus read from their books a commentary on the character of the Etruscans and are interrupted by the off-stage mutterings of Collatinus, Junius, Bianca and Lucia about the corruption of Rome under their rule. The Choruses discard their books and explain that they are viewing the action from the standpoint of the present day and according to Christian standards.\nThe curtain rises, showing Lucretia asleep with a candle beside her. Tarquinius approaches steathily, described by Male Chorus. He wakes Lucretia with a kiss and she reveals her deep-seated fear of him: \"In the forest of my dreams you have always been the Tiger.\"\nHe begs for her love and when she refuses siezes her forcibly. She struggles free and he threatens her with his sword, the Choruses commenting the while. As Tarquinius beats out the candle with his sword the curtain falls quickly.\nINTERLUDE\nThe Choruses lament the triumph of sin and pray for relief.\nSCENE 2: The hall of Lucretia's house the next morning\nBianca and Lucia greet the lovely day and collect flowers to adorn the house. They leave the orchids for Lucretia to arrange as they are Collatinus' favorite flowers. Bianca says that she thinks she heard Tarquinius gallop away before dawn. She is glad that Lucretia is still asleep because she is so often wakeful, pining for Collatinus.\nLucretia appears and tells Bianca that she slept \"as heavily as death.\" When Bianca gives her the orchids her calm is suddenly shattered and she cries out in horror at them. She tells Lucia to send a message to Collatinus with one of the flowers. The message is wild and distraught: \"Give him this orchid and tell him a Roman harlot sent it.\"\nLucretia then takes the flowers but twines them into a wreath. Bianca is perturbed at this, but Lucretia reminds her how she had taught herself to weave garlands when she was young. Lucretia goes and Bianca remembers her in happy former days. When Lucia comes back Bianca tells her the message must not be sent, even though Lucretia had ordered it: \"Sometimes a good servant should forget an order.\"\nBut it is too late: Collatinus has already come, accompanied by Junius who had heard Tarquinius leave the camp and return at dawn and warned Collatinus \"too late\", as Collatinus tells him as Lucretia approaches dressed in purple mourning garments.\nCollatinus and Lucretia speak of the intensity of their love: \"To love as we loved was to live on the edge of tragedy.\" Lucretia tells him how Tarquinius had raped her and thus violated the integrity of their love. Collatinus tries to comfort her with the argument that there was no shame since she had not consented, but she feels too deeply shamed and stabs herself.\nCollatinus, Junius, Bianca and Lucia utter a lament in which Male and Female Chorus join.

(\"Presto, presto ... su, corraggio\") The servants repudiate her assertions. The hotel's doctor, Don Prudenzio, announces that, because of the impending arrivals, the normal business of the spa will be suspended. The spa attendants rejoice and depart. He checks with Antonio that his instructions about the necessary meals for the visitors have been followed.\nMadame Cortese, the proprietress of the hotel, appears. She regrets that she will be unable to attend the coronation (\"Di vaghi raggi adorno\"), but is keen to show off the hotel to the visitors in the hope that they will return some day to take the waters. She particularly requests that everyone should be enthusiastic about each of the travellers' specific interests. Everyone agrees, and she is left alone.\nScene 2: The Countess of Folleville's arrival\nThe Countess calls for her maid, Modestina, and Madame Cortese goes to search for her. Modestina appears, and the Countess, worried that her clothes have not yet arrived, asks why there has been no reply to a letter that she had sent. Modestina had entrusted the letter to the Countess's cousin, Don Luigino, who immediately arrives to say that the stagecoach which he had hired to carry the boxes had overturned on the way. The Countess faints and Don Luigino calls for help.\nMaddalena, Antonio, Don Prudenzio and the servants arrive, together with Baron Trombonok. Don Prudenzio and the Baron argue about how to resuscitate the Countess, but she recovers sufficiently to lament the loss of her garments. (\"Partir, o ciel! desio\") However, when Modestina appears with a large box containing a beautiful Paris bonnet, she rejoices that it, at least, has been saved from the accident. (\"Che miro! Ah! Quel sorpresa!\") Everyone is amused by this sudden turn of events, and all except Antonio and the Baron depart.\nScene 3: Sextet\nAfter agreeing with the Baron the arrangements for party's departure in the evening, Antonio leaves. The Baron cannot help laughing at the Countess's sudden recovery and the insanity of the world in general. He is joined by Don Profondo, Don Alvaro, the Marquise Melibea, Count Libenskof. It is clear that Don Alvaro and the Count are rivals for the Marquise's affections. They are all waiting for the new horses which will be necessary for the continuation of the journey, but Madame Cortese, who now arrives, says that she cannot understand why they have not arrived. Alvaro and Libenskof quarrel, the ladies are alarmed, and the Baron and Don Profondo are amused by the idiocy of lovers. (\"Non pavento alcun periglio\")\nA harp prelude is heard, and the poetess Corinna sings offstage of brotherly love, to everyone's delight. (\"Arpa gentil\")\n Act 2\nScene 1: Lord Sidney's aria\nMadame Cortese is still waiting for the return of her servant Gelsomino with news of the horses. Lord Sidney approaches, and she muses on his unwillingness to approach Corinna who, she is sure, reciprocates his love.\nSidney, alone, laments his situation. (\"Invan strappar dal core\") His mood lifts when girls singing in praise of Corinna enter with flowers, but then he is disturbed by Don Profondo's strange requests for information about the location of antiquities, and departs.\nScene 2: Corinna's duet with the Chevalier Belfiore\nProfondo is joined by Corinna and her companion Delia. Corinna asks when the party is to depart, and he and Delia leave Corinna alone while they go to see whether the horses have arrived.\nCorinna is joined by the Chevalier, who declares his love. (\"Nel suo divin sembiante\") She is taken aback and repudiates him. The Chevalier retreats, hoping to try again later, and Corinna returns to her room.\nScene 3: Don Profondo's aria\nDon Profondo, who has seen the Chevalier with Corinna, reflects that the Countess will scratch the Chevalier's eyes out if she finds out what he has been doing. He then turns his attention to enumerating the effects of his fellow-travellers (as requested by the Baron), noting that their possessions tend to sum up their each of their nations' characteristics. (\"Medaglie incomparabili\") He looks forward to the impending departure.\nThe Countess appears, looking for the Chevalier. She is not pleased when Don Profondo tells her that he has been having a poetry lesson. Don Alvaro and Count Libenskof join them, asking about the horses, and the Baron, too, appears, looking woebegone. What has happened? The rest of the travellers arrive, and the Baron produces the courier Zefirino, who is obliged to report that there are no horses to be had anywhere, not even for ready money. There will be no journey to Reims for the coronation!\nScene 4: Grand concerted ensemble for 14 voices\nEveryone is horrified. (\"Ah! A tal colpo inaspettato\") But Madame Cortese appears with a letter from Paris. Don Profondo reads it out: the King will return from Reims in a few days and there will be great festivities. Anyone who was unable to get to Reims will be consoled by an even finer spectacle. The Countess steps forward to invite the entire company to her home in Paris for the celebrations. A stagecoach will convey them there on the following day, but in the meantime a grand banquet, with invitations to the public, will be held at the Golden Lily, paid for with the money that would have been spent at the coronation. Any money left over will be given to the poor.\n Act 3\nScene 1: Duet for the Count and the Marquise\nWhen everyone else has left, the Baron tries to reconcile the jealous Count with the Marquise, who has been seen with Don Alvaro. When he departs, the misunderstanding is resolved and harmony is restored. (\"D'alma celeste, oh Dio!\")\nThey depart, and the scene changes to the hotel's garden. Antonio and Maddalena ensure that all is prepared for the banquet. The Baron has engaged a travelling company to provide entertainment with singing and dancing.\nScene 2: Finale\nAfter the opening chorus (\"L'allegria \u00e8 un sommo bene\"), the Baron introduces a series of short national songs sung by each of the travellers, some of them set to well-known tunes, and ending with, first, a French anthem for the Chevalier and the Countess, then a rustic Tyrolean duet for Madame Cortese and Don Profondo, and finally an improvised solo for Corinna on one of a number of mostly French subjects suggested by each traveller and drawn from an urn.

The servants of the public authority busily shut up or pull down the houses of popular amusement in a suburb of Palermo, and carry off the inmates as prisoners. The populace oppose this first step, and much scuffling ensues.\nLuzio, a young nobleman and juvenile scapegrace, seems inclined to thrust himself forward as leader of the mob, and at once finds an occasion for playing a more active part in the cause of the oppressed people on discovering his friend Claudio being led away to prison. From him he learns that, in pursuance of some musty old law unearthed by Friedrich, he is to suffer the penalty of death for a certain love escapade in which he is involved. His sweetheart, union with whom had been prevented by the enmity of their parents, has borne him a child. Friedrich's puritanical zeal joins cause with the parents' hatred; he fears the worst, and sees his only hope for mercy if his sister Isabella, by her entreaties, can melt the Regent's hard heart. Claudio implores his friend at once to seek out Isabella in the convent of the Sisters of St. Elizabeth, which she has recently entered as novice.\nA convent\nIsabella is in confidential intercourse with her friend Marianne, also a novice. Marianne reveals to her friend, from whom she has long been parted, the unhappy fate which has brought her to the place. Under vows of eternal fidelity she had been persuaded to a secret liaison with a man of high rank. But finally, when in extreme need she found herself not only forsaken, but threatened by her betrayer, she discovered him to be the mightiest man in the state, none other than the King's Regent himself. Isabella's indignation finds vent in impassioned words, and is only pacified by her determination to forsake a world in which so vile a crime can go unpunished.\nWhen now Luzio brings her tidings of her own brother's fate, Isabella's disgust at her brother's misconduct is turned at once to scorn for the villainy of the hypocritical Regent, who presumes so cruelly to punish the comparatively venial offense of her brother, which, at least, was not stained by treachery. Her violent outburst imprudently reveals her to Luzio in a seductive aspect; smitten with sudden love, he urges her to quit the convent for ever and to accept his hand. She contrives to check his boldness, but resolves at once to avail herself of his escort to the Regent's court of justice.\nA courtroom\nSeveral persons are charged by the sbirro captain with offenses against morality. The earnestness of the situation becomes more marked when the gloomy form of Friedrich strides through the inrushing and unruly crowd, commanding silence, and he himself undertakes the hearing of Claudio's case in the sternest manner possible. The implacable judge is already on the point of pronouncing sentence when Isabella enters, and requests, before them all, a private interview with the Regent.\nIn this interview she behaves with noble moderation towards the dreaded yet despised man before her, and appeals at first only to his mildness and mercy. His interruptions merely serve to stimulate her ardor: she speaks of her brother's offense in melting accents, and implores forgiveness. Friedrich can no longer contain himself, and promises to grant her petition at the price of her own love. Filled with indignation at such villainy, she cries to the people through doors and windows to come in, that she may unmask the hypocrite before the world. By a few significant hints, Friedrich, with frantic energy, succeeds in making Isabella realize the impossibility of her plan. But a few words on her part suffice to transport the Regent himself with ecstasy; for in a whisper she promises to grant his desire, and that on the following night she shall send him such a message as shall ensure his happiness.\nAnd so ends the first act in a whirl of excitement.\n Act 2\nA prison\nIsabella visits her brother in his cell. She reveals Friedrich's shameful proposal to him, and asks if he would wish to save his life at the price of his sister's dishonour. Then follow Claudio's fury and fervent declaration of his readiness to die; whereupon, the unhappy man declines from a state of melancholy to one of weakness. Isabella hesitates in dismay when she sees him fall in this way. Disgusted, she springs to her feet, and declares that to the shame of his death he has further added her most hearty contempt.\nAfter having handed him over again to his gaoler, her mood once more changes swiftly to one of wanton gaiety. True, she resolves to punish the waverer by leaving him for a time in uncertainty as to his fate; but stands firm by her resolve to rid the world of the abominable seducer who dared to dictate laws to his fellow-men.\nShe tells Marianne that she must take her place at the nocturnal rendezvous, at which Friedrich so treacherously expected to meet her (Isabella), and sends Friedrich an invitation to this meeting. In order to entangle the latter even more deeply in ruin, she stipulates that he must come disguised and masked and fixes the rendezvous in one of those pleasure resorts which he has just suppressed.\nTo the madcap Luzio, whom she also desires to punish, she relates the story of Friedrich's proposal, and her pretended intention of complying with his desires. This she does in a fashion so incomprehensibly light-hearted that Luzio yields to a fit of desperate rage. He swears that, even if the noble maiden herself can endure such shame, he will himself strive by every means in his power to avert it. And, indeed, he arranges things in such a manner that on the appointed evening all his friends and acquaintances assemble at the end of the Corso, as though for the opening of the prohibited carnival procession.\nOutside Friedrich's Palace\nAt nightfall, Luzio appears sings an extravagant carnival song by which means he seeks to stir the crowd to bloody revolt. When a band of sbirri approaches, under Brighella's leadership, to scatter the gay throng, the mutinous project seems on the point of being accomplished. For the present, however, Luzio prefers to yield and to disperse his followers, as he must first of all win the real leader of their enterprise: for here was the spot which Isabella had mischievously revealed to him as the place of her pretended meeting with the Regent.\nFor Friedrich, Luzio therefore lies in wait. Recognizing him in an elaborate disguise, he blocks his way and, as Friedrich violently breaks loose, is on the point of following him with shouts and drawn sword when, on a sign from Isabella, who is hidden among some bushes, he is himself stopped and led away. Isabella then advances, rejoicing in the thought of having restored the betrayed Marianne to her faithless spouse. Believing that she holds in her hand the promised pardon for her brother, she is just on the point of abandoning all thought of further vengeance when, breaking the seal, to her intense horror she recognizes by the light of a torch that the paper contains but a still more severe order of execution, which, owing to her desire not to disclose to her brother the fact of his pardon, a mere chance had now delivered into her hand, through the agency of the bribed gaoler.\nAfter a hard fight with the tempestuous passion of love, and recognizing his helplessness against this enemy of his peace, Friedrich has in fact already resolved to face his ruin, even though as a criminal, yet still as a man of honor. An hour on Isabella's breast, and then - his own death by the same law whose implacable severity shall also claim Claudio's life. Isabella, perceiving in this conduct only a further proof of the hypocrite's villainy, breaks out once more into a tempest of agonized despair.\nUpon her cry for immediate revolt against the scoundrelly tyrant, the people collect together and form a motley and passionate crowd. Luzio, who also returns, counsels the people with stinging bitterness to pay no heed to the woman's fury; he points out that she is only tricking them - for he still believes in her shameless infidelity. Fresh confusion; increased despair of Isabella; suddenly from the background comes the burlesque cry of Brighella for help, who, himself suffering from the pangs of jealousy, has by mistake arrested the masked Regent, and thus led to the latter's discovery. Friedrich is recognised, and Marianne, trembling on his breast, is also unmasked.\nCries of joy burst forth all round; the needful explanations are quickly given, and Friedrich sullenly demands to be set before the judgment-seat of the returning King. Claudio, released from prison by the jubilant populace, informs him that the sentence of death for crimes of love is not intended for all times; messengers arrive to announce the unexpected arrival in harbor of the King; it is resolved to march in full masked procession to meet the beloved Prince, and joyously to pay him homage, all being convinced that he will heartily rejoice to see how ill the gloomy puritanism of Germany is suited to his hot-blooded Sicily."},{"opera_title":"Le Proph\u00e8te","composer":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","synopsis":"Time: The religious wars of 16th centuryPlace: Germany.\n\t(Jean de Leyde (based on the historical John of Leiden), whose beloved, Berthe, is coveted by Count Oberthal, ruler of Dordrecht, is persuaded by a trio of sinister Anabaptists to proclaim himself king in M\u00fcnster)\n\tOverture\n\tMeyerbeer originally wrote a long overture for the opera but this was cut, with various other sections of the work, during rehearsals due to the excessive length of the opera itself.\n\tThe overture now survives only in the arrangement made for piano solo or duet made at Meyerbeer's request by Charles-Valentin Alkan.\n\tAct 1\n\tBefore Oberthal's castle\n\tBerthe explains to Fid\u00e8s that she needs the Count's permission to marry Jean.

She lives in a beautiful enclosed garden on the king's estate. Her attendants bring flowers and sing to her. She declares her sadness, and her vague sense that she is missing something important that other people can experience.\n\tScene 2\n\tAfter announcing the king's arrival, Alm\u00e9ric is warned by Bertrand not to speak of light with Iolanta or to reveal that Iolanta's father is the king. She is betrothed to Duke Robert, who is also unaware of her blindness. The king arrives with Ibn-Hakia, a Moorish physician who states that Iolanta can be cured, but the physical cure will only work if she is psychologically prepared by being made aware of her own blindness. Ibn-Hakia sings the monologue \"Two worlds\", explaining the interdependence of the mind and the body within the divinely ordained universe, which merges spirit and matter. The king refuses the treatment, fearing for Iolanta's happiness if the cure should fail after she has learned what she is missing.\n\tScene 3\n\tRobert arrives at the court with his friend Vaud\u00e9mont.

Her mistress Lady Billows is organizing the annual May Day festival, and has gathered all the important people of the village to vet nominees for the coveted position of Queen of the May. But Florence has dug up dirt on every single girl nominated, proving that none is worthy to wear the May Queen's crown. Lady Billows is depressed. Superintendent Budd suggests that the solution may be to select, this year, a May King instead of a May Queen. He knows of a young man in town who is as certainly virginal as the girls are not: Albert Herring.\nAt the greengrocer's, Albert is teased for his timidity by the easygoing Sid. Sid's girlfriend Nancy comes in to do some shopping, and the couple shares a tender moment while Albert eats his heart out.

Sid and Nancy are preparing the banquet tent, and they take the chance to slip some rum into Albert's lemonade glass. Albert is tongue-tied at the feast in his honor, but drinks his lemonade greedily, which Britten satirically illustrates with a quote from Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde.

The fairy-king has set a condition which Farzana believes that Arindal will not fulfil even with the help of the magician Groma. Nevertheless, they get the other fairies and spirits to pledge their help in separating Ada from the mortal.\n\tIn a rocky wilderness Morald and Gunther meet Gernot. The former pair have been sent to find out what has happened to Arindal, who disappeared eight years ago. In the mean time his father, the king, has died from grief and the kingdom is being attacked by their enemy Murold who demands they surrender Arindal's sister Lora as his wife. Gernot relates how he and Arindal had hunted a beautiful doe to a river where it vanished. They heard a voice and jumped into the river where they found a beautiful woman in luxurious surroundings. She declared her love for Arindal and said they could stay together provided Arindal could go eight years without asking who she is. But the day before he did ask her, and Arindal and Gernot found themselves in the wilderness. Morald and Gunther depart before Arindal can know of their presence. Arindal appears and sings of his grief at the loss of Ada (Wo find ich dich, wo wird mir Trost?). Gernot tries to argue him round to believing that Ada is a sorceress who has abandoned him and that he should return to his kingdom. He sings of an evil witch who had disguised herself as a beautiful woman (War einst 'ne b\u00f6se Hexe wohl). Gunther returns, disguised as a priest, and continues the attempt to persuade Arindal that he will be turned into a wild beast by the witch unless he returns at once; Morald similarly disguises himself as the ghost of Arindal's father and announces that his kingdom is threatened. Each disguise is magically destroyed just as Arindal is about to be convinced. However, the three are finally able to persuade him of his country's need. They agree to depart in the morning, although Arindal fears he will not see Ada again. When he is left alone he falls into an enchanted sleep.\n\tThe scene changes again to a fairy garden with a palace in the background out of which Ada comes. She sings of how she is willing to sacrifice her immortality and pay the price, however hard it is, necessary to win Arindal (Wie muss ich doch beklagen). Arindal awakens and declares his joy at seeing Ada again, but she announces that he will abandon her the next day. Gernot, Gunther and Morald arrive with companions to fetch Arindal. Those who have not seen her before are struck by Ada's beauty and fear Arindal will not come. A procession of fairies comes out of the palace and Zemina and Farzana tell Ada that her father has died and she is now queen. Ada tells Arindal that they must part now but she will see him tomorrow. She asks him to swear that whatever happens he will not curse her. He swears it even though she takes back her request. She expresses her fear that they will both go under as a result of his breaking the oath.\n\tAct 2\n\tThe people and warriors in Arindal's capital are panicking because they are under attack. Lora berates them, saying that she herself stands firm even though she has lost father, brother and lover. She reminds them of Groma's prophecy that the kingdom will not fall if Arindal returns, but the chorus express doubts. Just as she begins to fear that they are right (O musst du Hoffnung schwinden), a messenger arrives to announce that Arindal is on his way. The new king is greeted joyously by his people, but Arindal himself expresses his fears that he is not strong enough for battle. Meanwhile Morald and Lora express their mutual love.\n\tAda is with Zemina and Farzana. She complains to them of how they heartlessly drive her on. They, however, express hope that she will renounce Arindal and remain immortal. She sings (Weh' mir, so nah' die f\u00fcrchterlische Stunde) of her fears that Arindal will be cursed with madness and death, and she with being turned to a statue, but then expresses hope that Arindal's love will prove strong.\n\tGernot and Gunther talk of the terrible omens of the night and morning. Gernot asks Gunther if Drolla is still beautiful and still loyal to him. Gunther says he believes so but says Gernot should ask her himself as she is nearby. Gernot and Drolla test each other with stories of the many people who love them. Each becomes jealous before they realise that they both truly love each other.\n\tBattle is raging outside. Arindal is anxious and refuses to lead the army out. Morald does so instead. Ada appears with her two children by Arindal. She seems to throw them into a fiery abyss. Meanwhile defeated warriors rush in. Ada refuses to console Arindal saying she has come to torment him instead. More defeated warriors arrive with reports that Morald has disappeared, captured or dead. Then Harald, who was sent to bring reinforcements, comes. He reports that his army was defeated by one led by Ada. Arindal curses her. Zemina and Farzana express joy that Ada will remain immortal. But she sorrowfully explains that the fairy-king had required as a condition of her renouncing her immortality, that she conceal her fairy background from Arindal for eight years and on the last day torment him as best she can. If he cursed her, she would remain immortal and be turned to stone for a hundred years while he would go mad and die. In truth, Morald is not dead, the army Harald led was full of traitors, and the children are still alive. Already Arindal can feel his sanity slipping.\n\tAct 3\n\tA chorus hail Morald and Lora as the King and Queen who have brought them peace. The couple say they cannot rejoice, because of Arindal's fate. All pray for the curse to be lifted.\n\tArindal is hallucinating that he is hunting a doe. As it is killed, he realises it is his wife. He continues to experience visions (Ich seh' den Himmel) before falling asleep. The voice of the petrified but weeping Ada is heard calling for him. Then the voice of Groma calls to him too. A sword, shield and lyre appear which Groma says can win Arindal victory and a greater reward. Zemina and Farzana, enter. The former expresses her pity for Arindal while the latter says he deserves punishment for seeking to take Ada from them. They wake him and announce they will lead him to Ada to rescue her. He expresses his willingness to die for her. The two fairies hope this will actually happen.\n\tThey lead Arindal to a portal guarded by earth spirits. He is about to be defeated when the voice of Groma reminds him of the shield. The earth spirits disappear when he holds it up. The fairies express their surprise but are sure he will not triumph again. Meanwhile he thanks Groma's power. Next they encounter bronze men who guard a holy sanctuary. The shield fails Arindal but when Groma advises him to hold up the sword, the bronze men vanish. The fairies again express their surprise whilst Groma's spirit urges Arindal on. They now have reached a grotto where Ada has been turned to stone. The two fairies taunt Arindal with the threat that failure will mean that he too is turned to stone. But the voice of Groma urges him to play the lyre. When he does so (O ihr, des Busens Hochgef\u00fchle), Ada is freed from the stone. The two fairies realise that Groma is responsible.\n\tThe scene changes to the fairy king's throne room. He has decided to grant Arindal immortality. Ada invites him to rule her fairyland with her.

In fact she is the sorceress Armida and in league with Idraote, who has entered with her in disguise. Their plan is to weaken the Crusaders by enslaving some of their best soldiers.

Armida and Rinaldo, who is the Crusaders' best soldier, had met once before, and she is secretly in love with him. She now confronts him and reminds him how she saved his life on that occasion.

The visit is due to end the following day.\n Scene 1\nThe first Audience Song is sung before the curtain rises to reveal the children's nursery at Iken Hall, which Rowan the nursery-maid is covering in dust-sheets in preparation for a visit from the chimney-sweeps. Miss Baggot, the elderly sharp-tongued housekeeper, escorts in Black Bob, the master-sweep, and his son Clem, \"a brutal apprentice as black as his dad\". Last of all Sam trails in, a small white figure struggling with an armful of buckets and rope. While Miss Baggot gives the instructions, Rowan is shocked by the wretchedness of the little boy, and begs the sweeps not to send him up the chimney. The sweeps mock her and pallid white Sammy as they drive him up his first chimney, to be transformed into a black, \"chimbley-stack\" boy. Rowan runs from the room in distress, and the sweeps leave to prepare the next chimney.\nThe door opens and Juliet enters furtively, before climbing into an armchair and covering herself with a dust-sheet. The children are playing hide-and-seek, apparently the version known as sardines. Jonny finds Juliet and joins her in her hiding-place, but their game is interrupted by a cry of distress from Sammy, who has become stuck in the chimney. The commotion attracts the other four children, and they succeed in extricating the sweep-boy from his predicament while singing the shanty Pull the rope gently. Like Rowan, the children are horrified by Sammy's condition. They decide to hide him in the nursery while faking up a line of footprints to make it seem as if he has escaped through the window.\nMiss Baggott and Rowan return with the sweeps, and are thoroughly taken in by the ruse. Black Bob and Clem run off in search of Sammy, pursued by Miss Baggott insisting that they get on with the job. Thinking herself alone, Rowan sings an aria (Run, poor sweep-boy) expressing her wish that she could help Sam escape. Overhearing this, the children gradually emerge from under the dust-sheets and set about persuading her to help them get Sam away from the sweeps. A decision is taken to feed him and bath him, and the curtain falls on the preparations for the bath.\n Scene 2\nThe second Audience Song is again sung to a closed curtain, vividly describing the splashing and scrubbing which is happening out of sight. The curtain rises to reveal Sam, \"whiter than swans as they fly\", and Juliet begins to question him about his background. He reveals that his father is a waggoner who broke his hip so that he couldn't work, and Sammy was sold into an apprenticeship with the sweeps because \"there wasn't anyting to eat\". Sammy stoically declares that it was time he began work, as \"I shall be nine next birthday\", and the wealthy children become even more dismayed. Sam reveals that his home is in the village of Little Glemham, which by coincidence is also Rowan's home.\nJonny conceives the plan of smuggling Sam into his travelling-trunk so that he can be carried out of the house unseen when the Crome children leave the following day. Rowan agrees, just as Miss Baggott returns in a furious rage over her treatment by the sweeps, who have accused her of hiding their apprentice. There is a mad scramble to hide Sammy and look as innocent and natural as possible as Miss Baggott enters the room. At the spectacle of the grubby, sooty, untidy state of the nursery, the housekeeper's ire is redirected towards the children. Seeing toys lying around she approaches the toy-cupboard where Sammy is hiding, reaching for the door-handle. In desperation Juliet fakes a fainting fit, which has the desired effect. Everyone fusses around Juliet, who is eventually carried to her bedroom, as Jonny reassures Sam and urges him to \"sit tight, and tomorrow you're a free man.\"\n Scene 3\nThe third Audience Song evokes the passing of the night. For this, the audience is divided into four groups, taking the parts of owls, herons, turtle-doves and chaffinches engaging in a singing competition. The curtain rises to reveal Juliet sitting in her dressing-gown, as Rowan enters carrying a tray with her breakfast. They call Sammy out of the cupboard and feed him Juliet's breakfast, while Juliet sings a charming farewell aria. Sammy tries to refuse the money Juliet gives him, but she is insistent. The other children enter, the three Cromes ready to leave for home. They pack Sammy into Jonny's trunk, with yet more food, only to run into a problem when it proves to be too heavy for Tom the coachman and Alfred the gardener to lift. The children and Rowan break into the growing argument between Miss Baggot and the men, and offer to help lift the trunk. The extra manpower does the trick, and Juliet, Gay and Sophie watch from the window as it is loaded into the coach taking Jonny and the twins away.\nAs soon as the coach has notionally departed, the entire cast returns to the stage for the Coaching Song. They form a tableau with a rocking-horse and chairs arranged to form a coach, and sing together with the audience, describing Sammy's journey to safety and freedom."},{"opera_title":"Salome","composer":"Richard Strauss","synopsis":"ONE AND ONLY ACT\nA terrace in Herod's palace\nNarraboth, captain of the guard, in charge of the prophet Jokanaan, who is imprisoned in a cistern,watches the Princess Salome at a banquet inside the palace. His friend, the page of Queen Herodias, fears the consequences of this fixation on Salome.\nThe voice of Jokanaan can be heard proclaiming the coming of Christ. One of the guards wants him silenced, but the other explains that he is a gentle and holy man. He tells a visiting Cappadocian that the prophet came from the desert where he had been followed by a great multitude.\nOppressed by the atmosphere and disturbed by the way Herod looks at her, Salome runs out from the banquet in time to hear another utterance from Jokanaan. Is this, she asks, the prophet of whom the Tetrarch is afraid and who has spoken against her mother? Narraboth is evasive, but does tell her that the prophet is quite a young man. She wishes to see him and when she learns that the Tetrarch has forbidden it she persuades the infatuated Narraboth to give the order for the prisoner to be brought out.\nAs he emerges, Jokanaan denounces the abominations of Herod and Herodias. Salome is fascinated and ignores Narraboth's entreaties that she leave. Jokanaan, suddenly aware of her, also demands that she go, but she answers proudly that she is Salome, daughter of Herodias. He orders her to stand back, as her mother has filled the earth with her iniquities. Salome begs him to speak again, and he orders her to leave him and go into the desert and seek out the Son of Man.\nIgnoring Narraboth's entreaties, and infatuated with Joakanaan, she begs to be allowed to touch his white body. He refuses angrily and she declares that his body is loathsome and leprous; instead, she is enamored of his black hair. When he spurns her again, she says that his hair is horrible, but she is in love with his mouth, and begs him to let her kiss it. \"Never,\" he replies, and the distraught Narraboth kills himself with his sword, unheeded by Salome, who continues to beg for the mouth of Jokanaan. He replies that she must seek out Christ, who alone can save her from her sins; but when she persists, he curses her and retires into the cistern.\nHerod appears on the terrace, looking for Salome, followed by Herodias, who tells him that he looks at Salome too much. He slips in the blood of Narraboth and orders the body removed. In a nervous state, he claims he hears the rushing of a great wind, but Herodias tells him he is sick. He offers Salome wine, so that he may drain the cup; fruit, which he will finish, and her mother's throne, but she answers in turn that she is not hungry, thirsty or tired. Herod is aggrieved, but Herodias approves her daughter's replies.\nThe voice of Jokanaan is heard proclaiming the imminence of the wrath of God and Herodias demands that he be silenced. Herod refuses, claiming that he is a great prophet, and denying Herodias' claim that he is afraid. His insistence that Jokanaan is a great prophet who has seen God provokes a great argument among a party of Jews, aggravated by two Nazarenes who proclaim that the Messiah has come. To calm the storm, Herod asks Salome to dance. She refuses until he promises to give her whatever she asks. Extracting an oath to this effect, she performs the dance of the seven veils.\nWhen she names as her reward the head of Jokanaan on a silver salver, Herodias is jubilant but Herod is aghast and tries to bribe her with alternate treasures, unto half his kingdom and the veil of the temple; but in the face of her determination, has to give way.\nAs he collapses on his throne, Herodias takes his ring and hands it to the executioner who goes down into the cistern and, after a long silence, emerges with the head. As Salome seizes it exultantly, Herodias looks on with satisfaction, Herod hides his head and the Nazarenes pray. Salome addresses the head with a mixture of triumph, derision and regret, finally kissing the mouth. Herod orders her to be killed and the soldiers crush her with their shields."},{"opera_title":"La Wally","composer":"Alfredo Catalani","synopsis":"The story is set in the Austrian Tyrol where the free-spirited but vulnerable Wally is in love with the handsome Giuseppe Hagenbach, the son of her father's implacable enemy. This leads to the inevitable disastrous conclusion.\n Act 1\nThe village of Hochstoff\nA shooting contest is being held in celebration of the 70th birthday of Wally's father, Stromminger. A hunting party arrives from the nearby village of S\u00f6lden led by Hagenbach. Old enmities quickly surface and a quarrel develops between Stromminger and Hagenbach, who trade threats and insults before Hagenbach is drawn away by his companions.\nVincenzo Gellner has his own heart set on Wally and is quick to notice that during the quarrel she is clearly infatuated with her father's enemy. When left alone with Stromminger, he tells the old man of his suspicions. Recognising that Gellner is in love with his daughter, he insists that Wally agrees to marry him within a month or else leave his house forever. Wally retorts that she would rather take her chances in the Alpine snows than marry Gellner.\n Act 2\nThe Eagle Tavern at S\u00f6lden\nA year has passed; Stromminger has died and Wally has inherited his fortune. However, Hagenbach has become engaged to Afra, the landlady of the Eagle Tavern, and is apparently not interested in Wally.\nA festival is taking place in S\u00f6lden and Wally is drawn to the tavern knowing that Hagenbach will be there. Hagenbach is persuaded to accept a challenge to try to win a kiss from Wally. What begins as a game quickly develops into something more serious, and Hagenbach easily wins his wager. When Wally realises she has been the victim of a cynical bet, her jealousy and fury boil over. She turns to Gellner, who is also at the festival, and insists that if he loves her he must kill Hagenbach.\n Act 3\nA ravine\nLa Wally returns to her home. The anger she felt has now subsided and she wishes she could take back her words. At that moment there is a knock at her door.

She herself goes down a rope to rescue him and successfully raises his unconscious body back to the surface.\n Act 4\nHigh in the Alps\nLonely and depressed, Wally has climbed into the mountains above the village. Her only friend, Walter, has followed and urges her to come down for the Christmas festivities and reminds her of the dangers of avalanches. She sends him away and contemplates her imminent death.\nWally hears another voice. It is Hagenbach, who has recovered from his injuries and come to confess his love. The lovers are reconciled and Hagenbach goes to find a safe path back down the mountain. He shouts up to Wally, but the noise of his call sets off an avalanche which carries him away.

Three fugitives from justice get out: Fatty the Bookkeeper, Trinity Moses, and Leocadia Begbick. Because the federal agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying where they are and founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because there is nothing else in the world to rely on.\nProblems listening to this file? See media help.\nScene 13 At the renovated \"Do It\" tavern.\nThe men sing of the four pleasures of life: Eating, Lovemaking, Fighting and Drinking. First comes eating: To kitschy cafe music, Jimmy's friend Jacob gorges until he keels over and dies. The men sing a chorale over his body, saluting \"a man without fear\".\nScene 14: Loving.\nWhile Begbick collects money and issues tips on behavior, Moses placates the impatient men waiting in line to make love to Jenny and the other whores. The men sing the \"Mandalay Song\", warning that love does not last forever, and urging those ahead of them to make it snappy.\nScene 15: Fighting.\nThe men flock to see a boxing match between Trinity Moses and Jim's friend Alaska Wolf Joe. While most of the men, including the ever-cautious Billy, bet on the burly Moses, Jim, out of friendship, bets heavily on Joe. The match is manifestly unfair; Moses not only wins but kills Joe in knocking him out.\nScene 16: Drinking.\nIn an effort to shake off the gloom of Joe's death, Jimmy invites everyone to have a drink on him. The men sing \"Life in Mahagonny\", describing how one could live in the city for only five dollars a day, but those who wanted to have fun always needed more. Jim, increasingly drunk, dreams of sailing back to Alaska. He takes down a curtain rod for a mast and climbs on the pool table, pretending it is a ship; Jenny and Billy play along. Jimmy is abruptly sobered up when Begbick demands payment for the whiskey as well as for the damage to her property. Totally broke, he turns in a panic to Jenny, who explains her refusal to help him out in the song \"Make your own bed\"\u00a0- an adaptation of the ideas he proclaimed at the end of act 1. Jim is led off in chains as the chorus, singing another stanza of \"Life in Mahagonny\", returns to its pastimes. Trinity Moses assures the crowd that Jimmy will pay for his crimes with his life.\nScene 17\nAt night, Jim alone and chained to a lamppost, sings a plea for the sun not to rise on the day of his impending trial.\n Act 3\nScene 18: In the courtroom\nMoses, like a carnival barker, sells tickets to the trials. He serves as prosecutor, Fatty as defense attorney, Begbick as judge. First comes the case of Toby Higgins, accused of premeditated murder for the purpose of testing an old revolver. Fatty invites the injured party to rise, but no one does so, since the dead do not speak. Toby bribes all three, and as a result, Begbick dismisses the case. Next Jimmy's case is called. Chained, he is led in by Billy, from whom he tries to borrow money; Billy of course refuses, despite Jim's plea to remember their time together in Alaska. In virtually the same speech he used to attack Higgins, Moses excoriates him for not paying his bills, for seducing Jenny (who presents herself as a plaintiff) to commit a \"carnal act\" with him for money, and for inciting the crowd with \"an illegal joyous song\" on the night of the typhoon. Billy, with the chorus's support, counters that, in committing the latter act, Jimmy discovered the laws by which Mahagonny lives. Moses argues that Jim hastened his friend Joe's death in a prizefight by betting on him, and Billy counters by asking who actually killed Joe. Moses does not reply. But there is no answer for the main count against him. Jim gets short sentences for his lesser crimes, but for having no money, he is sentenced to death. Begbick, Fatty and Moses, rising to identify themselves as the injured parties, proclaim \"in the whole human race \/ there is no greater criminal \/ than a man without money\". As Jim is led off to await execution, everyone sings the \"Benares Song\", in which they long for that exotic city \"where the sun is shining.\" But Benares has been destroyed by an earthquake. \"Where shall we go?\" they ask.\nScene 19: At the gallows\nJim says a tender goodbye to Jenny, who, dressed in white, declares herself his widow. He surrenders her to Billy, his last remaining companion from Alaska. When he tries to delay the execution by reminding the people of Mahagonny that God exists, they play out for him, under Moses' direction, the story of \"God in Mahagonny\", in which the Almighty condemns the town and is overthrown by its citizens, who declare that they can not be sent to Hell because they are already in Hell. Jim, chastened, asks only for a glass of water, but is refused even this as Moses gives the signal for the trap to be sprung.\nScene 20\nA caption advises that, after Jim's death, increasing hostility among the city's various factions has caused the destruction of Mahagonny. To a potpourri of themes from earlier in the opera, groups of protesters are seen on the march, in conflict with one another, while the city burns in the background. Jenny and the whores carry Jim's clothing and accessories like sacred relics; Billy and several men carry his coffin. In a new theme, they and the others declare, \"Nothing you can do will help a dead man\". Begbick, Fatty and Moses appear with placards of their own, joining the entire company in its march and declaring \"Nothing will help him or us or you now,\" as the opera ends in chaos."},{"opera_title":"Fra Diavolo","composer":"Daniel Auber","synopsis":"Fra Diavolo, or The Inn at Terracina\nACT ONE\n\tAlthough she is in love with a poor soldier, Lorenzo, Zerline is\n\tto marry the wealthy commoner, Francesco.

On seeing Origille, Orlando blows his cover, but is neatly manoeuvred by Brandimarte into concealing his true identity by pretending to be mad, under the illusion that he is Orlando. Under cover of \"madness,\" Orlando tells the bizarre story of how Origille betrayed him last time they met. When Argillano disappears to warn Ersilla of his suspicions, Origille begs forgiveness, and Orlando acquiesces. Argillano tells Ersilla that \"Leodilla\" is Grifone, and she interrogates him.

Here the event is the strong 1994 earthquake that hit the Los Angeles area, called the \"Northridge earthquake\" after the town nearest its epicenter. The title comes from a remark by a survivor, quoted in a newspaper.\nUnlike the other Adams operas to that point, the characters of this one are all fictional. There are seven leading characters. Like any good disaster movie, the opera first acquaints us with them and then places them against the background of the disaster, the earthquake. They include a black man with a minor criminal record (Dewain) and his \"undocumented immigrant\" lover, Consuelo; a local African-American Baptist Church minister (David) who is in love with Leila, a graduate student and Planned Parenthood clinic counselor; this love is unrequited. Also unrequited is the love of Tiffany, a \"pert, airbrushed anchorwoman\" for Mike, an idealistic young policeman. The seventh character is Rick, a young lawyer who was the son of Vietnamese boat people. The opera follows these characters in their various interrelationships.\nThe main plot line is set in motion when Mike happens upon Dewain during a minor shoplifting incident. Since Mike is then being filmed by Tiffany, he can't defuse the situation simply by returning the two bottles of beer Dewain lifted, and the situation escalates to an on-camera felony case of resisting an officer. Rick defends Dewain, trying to get the charges dismissed, since the offense would be a \"third strike\" under the state of California's habitual offender statute. He examines Tiffany on the witness stand and falls in love with her. That evening, David finally has a moment alone with Leila, in the church. They embrace as the earthquake strikes. This natural disaster changes everyone's life, reveals secrets, clarifies goals and characters. At the end, the whole cast sings a septet which is in the form of a slow, gentle passacaglia."},{"opera_title":"Doktor Faust","composer":"Ferruccio Busoni","synopsis":"The opera contains two prologues, an intermezzo, and three scenes.\n\tSymphonia\n\tOrchestral introduction: Easter Vespers and Augurs of Spring. The orchestra begins with bell imitations; later the chorus, behind the curtain, sings the single word: \"Pax\".\n\tThe poet speaks\n\tIn front of the curtain the poet speaks to the spectators explaining why he abandoned his earlier ideas of using Merlin and Don Juan as subject matter in favor of Faust. This spoken introduction emphasizes the play's origins in puppet theater. (This section is often omitted.)\n\tPrologue 1\n\tWittenberg, Germany, during the Middle Ages.\n\tFaust is Rector Magnificus of the university. While he is working on an experiment in his laboratory, Wagner, his pupil, brings word of three students from Krak\u00f3w, who have arrived unannounced to give Faust a book on black magic, Clavis Astartis Magica (The Key to the Magic of Astarte). Faust reflects on the power that will soon be his. The students come on stage, and tell him that this book is for him. When Faust asks what he must give in return, they say only \"Later\". He then asks whether he will see them again, and they respond \"Perhaps.\" They then depart. Wagner reappears, and after questioning from Faust, tells his teacher that he saw no one enter or leave. Faust concludes that these visitors were supernatural.\n\tPrologue 2\n\tMidnight that same evening.\n\tFaust opens the book and follows its directions. He makes a circle on the floor, steps into it and calls upon Lucifer to appear. A pale light is seen around the room, and then unseen voices materialize. Faust then wishes, as his 'Will', for spirits at his beck and call. Five flames appear, servants of Lucifer, but Faust is not impressed at their claims of speed. The sixth flame\/voice, Mephistopheles, claims that \"I am as swift as the thoughts of man\" (\"als wie des Menschen Gedanke\"). Faust then accepts Mephistopheles as a servant. He demands that all his wishes be granted, to have all knowledge and the power of genius. Mephistopheles, in return, says that Faust must serve him after death, which Faust recoils from at first. Mephistopheles reminds Faust that his creditors and enemies are at the door. With Faust's approval, Mephistopheles causes them to fall, dead. Then, with the chorus in the distance singing a 'Credo' on Easter morning, Faust signs the pact in blood, wondering what has become of his 'Will'. He faints upon realizing that he has forfeited his soul. Mephistopheles gleefully takes the contract in hand.\n\tIntermezzo\n\tBy this point, Faust has seduced the maiden Gretchen. At a chapel, her brother, a soldier, prays to find and punish the violator of his sister's honour. Mephistopheles points out the soldier to Faust, who wants to kill him, but not with his own hands. Mephistopheles disguises himself as a monk and offers to hear the Soldier's confession. A military patrol, surreptitiously directed by Mephistopheles, enters and kills the Soldier, claiming that the soldier had murdered their captain. The soldier's death is then to weigh on Faust's conscience.\n\tHauptspiel\n\tScene 1\n\tThe Ducal Park of Parma, Italy\n\tThe wedding ceremony for the Duke and Duchess of Parma is in process. The Master of Ceremonies announces a guest, the famous magician Dr. Faust. Faust enters with his herald (Mephistopheles). The Duchess is immediately smitten with Faust; the Duke surmises that \"Hell has sent him here.\" Faust alters the atmosphere to night to be able to perform his magic feats. The first, at the Duchess' request, is vision of King Solomon and Queen Balkis, who respectively resemble Faust and the Duchess. Second is Samson and Delilah. Third is John the Baptist with Salome. An Executioner (looking like the Duke) threatens the Baptist (resembling Faust), but the Duchess cries out that the Baptist must be saved. In an aside, Faust asks the Duchess to run off with him, but she is hesitant, if willing. The Duke declares the magic show concluded and announces supper. Mephistopheles warns Faust to flee, since the food is poisoned. The Duchess returns to tell Faust that she will accompany him. Mephistopheles, disguised as a court chaplain, returns with the Duke and advises him against chasing down Faust and the Duchess. Instead, he advises the Duke to marry the sister of the Duke of Ferrara, who is threatening war on the Duke of Parma.\n\tSymphonic intermezzo\n\tIn modo d'una Sarabanda\n\tScene 2\n\tAt a tavern in Wittenberg\n\tSome students talk of Plato and metaphysics, with Faust present. After Faust has responded to a question by saying that \"Nothing is proven, and nothing is provable\", with a citation of Martin Luther, the Catholic and Protestant students break into quarrel. Once that has subsided, Faust recalls his affair with the Duchess. Mephistopheles, disguised as a courier, brings the news that she has died and sent a gift to Faust. This is a baby's corpse, and Mephistopheles tosses it at Faust's feet. Mephistopheles tells the students of Faust's seduction of the Duchess, and subsequent abandonment. Mephistopheles then changes the dead infant into a bundle of straw and sets fire to it, from which comes a vision of Helen of Troy. The students recoil, and Mephistopheles departs. Faust attempts to embrace the vision, but it eludes him. In her place instead, the three Krak\u00f3w students materialize, to demand the return of the magic book. Faust tells them that he has destroyed it. The students then tell him that he will die at the stroke of midnight.\n\tScene 3\n\tA Wittenberg street, in the snow, outside the church.\n\tMephistopheles, in disguise as a Night Watchman, announces that it is eleven o'clock. Wagner, the successor to Faust as university Rector and now resident in Faust's former home, says good-night to a group of students. Faust enters, alone, and sees his old home. Voices from the church sing of judgment and salvation. Faust wants to try to redeem himself with one final good deed. He sees a beggar woman with a child, and realizes that she is the Duchess. She hands him the child, tells him that there is still time to complete his work before midnight, then vanishes. Faust then tries to enter the church, but the Soldier (from the Intermezzo) materializes to block his path. Faust tries to pray, but cannot remember the words. From the light of the Night Watchman's lamp, Faust sees the figure of the crucified Christ metamorphose into that of Helen of Troy. \"Gibt es keine Gnade?\" , he sings. (At this point in the Beaumont version Faust sings \"Euch zum Trotze ... die wir nennen b\u00f6se.... An dieser hohen Einsicht meiner Reife bricht sich nun eure Bosheit und in der mir errungnen Freiheit erlischt Gott und Teufel zugleich.\" ) In parallel with Prologue I, Faust forms a circle on the ground. He then steps into it with the child's body and, with one last supreme effort, he transfers his life-force to the child. The Night Watchman calls out the midnight hour; Faust falls dead; a naked youth arises with a blossoming branch in his right hand and steps forth into the night. The Night Watchman, now revealed as Mephistopheles, sees Faust's body on the ground, and asks \"Sollte dieser Mann verungl\u00fcckt sein?\". In the Beaumont ending Mephistopheles throws Faust's body onto his shoulders and walks off; distant voices repeat Faust's final words: \"Blut meines Blutes, Glied meines Gliedes, dir vermach' ich mein Leben, ich, Faust, ich, Faust, ein ewiger Wille.\"\n\tEpilogue\n\tThe poet speaks to the spectators.

Upon his return, the city and Lubava rejoice."},{"opera_title":"Semele","composer":"Georg Handel","synopsis":"ACT I\nThe action begins in Boeotia, at the Temple of Juno where the marriage of Semele, daughter of Cadmus, king of Thebes, and Athamas, a prince of Boeotia, is about to be solemnized.\nSemele seems reluctant: she does not want to forgo her present liaison with Jupiter. Suddenly thunder is heard (a sign of Jupiter's activity), and the fire on the altar is extinguished: eventually the altar sinks from sight, and the wedding is abandoned in face of these omens. Ino, Semele's sister, reveals her love for Athamas, and Cadmus reports that, as his party was leaving Juno's temple, an eagle swooped down and carried Semele away; Jupiter now enjoys Semele's favours 'above' (--> \nEndless pleasure, endless Love\n).\nACT II\nJuno is incensed by Jupiter's affair with Semele, and she determines to destroy the woman who has displaced her. She decides that she will need help from Somnus, the god of sleep.\nIn her palace, Semele awakes (--> \nO Sleep, why dost thon leave me?\n). \nJupiter enters and the two renew their affection. But Semele is not entirely happy: she is only a mortal, and feels frightened when Jupiter leaves her. In order to distract Semele from wishing for immortality, Jupiter brings Ino to Semele for company: he transforms the scene to Arcadia (--> \nWhere'er you walk\n) and leaves the sisters together to enjoy the harmony of the spheres.\nACT III\nJuno and her attendant messenger Iris visit Somnus' cave and (with some difficulty) awaken him. Among Juno's requests to Somnus is one that Ino  should be immobilized by sleep so that Juno can impersonate her when she visits Semele: in return Juno guarantees to Somnus the lady that he desires, Pasithea.\nJuno, disguised as Ino, goes to Semele; she asks whether Jupiter has consented to Semele's request to join the immortals. Semele replies that she is still mortal, and Juno gives her a mirror in order to admire her own features. \nSemele gains confidence from what she sees in the mirror and Juno suggests that Semele should use her attractions to make Jupiter approach her bed \"Not ... In Likeness of a Mortal, but like himself, the mighty Thunderer\": by that means, Juno says, Semele will \"partake of immortality\" and be called from the mortal state.\nJuno leaves as she hears Jupiter approach. Jupiter allows himself to be lured into promising to grant whatever Semele requests. When Semele asks him to appear \"like Jove\", Jupiter tries to dissuade her, but to no avail. Jupiter knows that if he appears as he really is, Semele will be consumed by his fire. And thus it turns out: Semele sees Jupiter afar in his true form, and dies. The chorus reflects on ambition that overreaches itself.\nIno, returned to the world of mortals, relates that in a dream Hermes told Ino that it was Jove's wish that she should now marry Athamas. Athamas enters willingly into the union.\nA cloud descends on Mount Citheron, in which Apollo is discovered. He predicts that better times lie ahead, and specifically refers to the creation of Bacchus: \"From Semele's ashes a Phoenix shall rise\"."},{"opera_title":"Thamos, K\u00f6nig in \u00c4gypten","composer":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","synopsis":"Thamos, King in Egypt\nNo. 1 - Chorus\nPRIESTS, VIRGINS\nThe night, day's enemy, gives place to you, o Sun!\nFrom Egypt a fresh victim is offered to you:\nhear our prayer!

Paris and Helen meet at her royal palace and each is struck by the other's beauty. She calls on him to judge an athletic contest and when asked to sing he does so in praise of her beauty, admitting the purpose of his visit is to win her love. She dismisses him. In despair Paris now pleads with her, and she begins to give way. Eventually, through the intervention of Erasto, who now reveals himself as Cupid, she gives way, but Pallas Athene (Athena) now warns them of sorrow to come. In the final scene Paris and Helen make ready to embark for Troy.\nParide ed Elena (Paris and Helen) is the third of Gluck's so-called reform operas for Vienna, following Alceste (Alcestis) and Orfeo ed Euridice (Orpheus and Eurydice), and the least often performed of the three. Arias from the opera that enjoy an independent concert existence include Paris's minor-key declaration of love, O del mio dolce ardor (O of my gentle love), in the first act. His second aria is Spiagge amate (Beloved shores). In the second act, again in a minor key, Paris fears that he may lose Helen in Le belle imagini (The fair semblance) and in the fourth would prefer death to life without Helen, Di te scordarmi, e vivere (To forget you and to live). The r\u00f4le of Paris offers difficulties of casting, written, as it was, for a relatively high castrato voice.

The sisters rejoice because, as the Mistress of Novices explains, this is the first of three evenings that occur each year when the setting sun strikes the fountain to turn its water golden. This event causes the sisters to remember a sister who has died, Bianca Rosa. Sister Genevieve suggests they pour some of the golden water onto her tomb.\nThe nuns then discuss their desires - while the Monitor believes that any desire at all is wrong, Sister Genevieve confesses that she wishes to see lambs again because she used to be a shepherdess when she was a girl, and Sister Dolcina wishes for something good to eat. Sister Angelica claims to have no desires, but as soon as she says so, the nuns begin gossiping - Sister Angelica has lied, because her true desire is to hear from her wealthy, noble family, whom she has not heard from in seven years. The rumors have it that she was sent to the convent in punishment.\nThe conversation is interrupted by the Infirmary Sister, who begs Sister Angelica to make a herbal remedy - Sister Angelica's specialty. Two touri\u00e8res then arrive, bringing supplies to the convent, as well as news that a grand coach is waiting outside the convent. Sister Angelica immediately becomes nervous and upset, thinking rightly that someone in her family has come to visit her. The Abbess chastises Sister Angelica for her inappropriate excitement and then goes on to announce the visitor, the Princess, Sister Angelica's aunt.\nThe Princess explains that Angelica's sister is to be married and that Angelica must sign a document renouncing her claim to her inheritance. Angelica replies that she has repented for her sin, but there is one thing she cannot offer in sacrifice to the Virgin - she cannot forget the memory of her illegitimate son who was taken from her seven years ago. The Princess refuses to speak, but finally informs Sister Angelica that her son died of fever two years ago. Sister Angelica, devastated, signs the document and collapses in tears. The Princess leaves.\nSister Angelica is seized by a heavenly vision - she believes she hears her son calling for her to meet him in paradise. She makes herself a poison and drinks it, but realizes that in committing suicide, she has committed a mortal sin and has damned herself to eternal separation from her son. She begs the Virgin Mary for mercy and, as she dies, she sees a miracle: the Virgin Mary appears, along with Sister Angelica's son, who runs to embrace her."},{"opera_title":"Zelmira","composer":"Giaochino Rossini","synopsis":"The opera's complicated plot revolves around Zelmira, her father Polidoro, the wise and beloved king of the Isle of Lesbos, and her husband, Prince Ilo.

While he was gone, Azor, the lord of Mytilene and a disappointed suitor of Zelmira, had invaded Lesbos with the intention of assassinating King Polidoro and taking over his throne. Zelmira, however, had managed to conceal her father in the royal mausoleum and then told Azor that he was hiding in the temple to Ceres. Azor burnt down the temple, thinking he had killed the King, but he was in turn killed on orders from Antenore, who also aspired to the throne.\n Act 1\nThe Mytilene warriors are mourning the death of Azor. Antenore, with the help of Leucippo, plots to take over the throne of Lesbos by trying to incriminate Zelmira in the deaths of Azor and her father. At first, even Emma, Zelmira's confidante, believes the accusations. Fearing for the safety of her young son, Zelmira reveals to Emma that her father is still alive and asks her to take the child into hiding. Prince Ilo returns to the island. Zelmira is afraid to tell him of the accusations against her or to defend herself. Instead, Prince Ilo hears only Antenore's version of the story. Antenore is crowned King of Lesbos. Leucippo attempts to murder Ilo, but is stopped by Zelmira. Found with the dagger in her hand, Zelmira is now also accused of attempting to murder her husband and is imprisoned.\n Act 2\nLeucippo intercepts a letter from Zelmira to Ilo in which she tells him that her father is still alive and that the accusations against her are false.

He is then surprised to find that the unhappy objects in his room come to life. The furniture and decorations begin to talk; even his homework takes shape as it becomes an old man and a chorus of numbers.\n\tPart 2\n\tThe bedroom becomes a garden filled with singing animals and plants which have been tortured by the child as well.

Under the impression that Paolo is her destined bridegroom, Francesca falls deeply in love with him at first sight; he also falls passionately in love with her, although they do not exchange a single word.\n\tThe next act shows a fight in progress between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and on the platform of a tower of the Malatesti, Francesca, now married to Gianciotto, meets Paolo and gently reproaches him for the fraud practised on her.

After Francesca refuses to give in to his sexual advances, Malatestino betrays Francesca and Paolo to Gianciotto, who determines to find out the truth for himself.

Seeing that Jean is filled with remorse, the Prior asks him to join the order of monks. Jean does so, and is befriended by the monastery's cook, Boniface who tells him the legend of the sagebush which opened its branches to shelter the Infant Jesus as He slept.

Jean at first is totally unaware of anything, but suddenly cries out that he finally understands Latin (the traditional language of the Catholic Mass).

These majos and majas are known for their bohemian attitude and soft spot for finery. The opening scene is directly based on his 1791 painting \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEl Pelele', painted for Charles IV of Spain to hang in his textile mill, although the painting implies a satire of the monarch's popularity.\n First Tableau\nThe majos and majas are enjoying an afternoon outside the Church of San Antonio de la Florida. As the Manzanares River meanders in the distance, the fun loving troupe spend their time dancing, feasting, and playing a traditional game known as the pelele. This game involves a human replication made of straw being thrown up in the air by a group using a stretched out sheet. As they flirt and chatter, Paquiro enters, surrounded by women. He calls all the ladies unique garden flowers, and they swoon for him, but all of them know who he supposedly belongs to. Pepa enters the scene riding her dog cart, and the men crowd around her excitedly, as she thanks them for making her feel welcome. Suddenly, the attention is on two richly dressed lackeys bearing a sedan-chair, and in which the high born lady Rosario waits for her lover. Paquiro wastes no time approaching this mystery woman. He recalls a time when she appeared at one of their lantern-lit balls, and invites her again that very night. Rosario ignores him, but her indifference goes unnoticed by Fernando, captain of the royal guard, who was hiding away and spying on her and Paquiro. Fernando assumes that she was flirting, and although she flatly denies it, he does not trust her. They continue arguing while Pepa and the ladies mock them. Fernando decides that Rosario will accept the invitation, but that he will accompany her. They leave promptly, and after sharing their plans to ruin the lovers, Pepa and Paquiro leave on their dog cart.\n Second Tableau\nAt the ball that night, all the majas are dancing, while the majos watch eagerly. Fernando enters dragging Rosario, whom Pepa proceeds to make fun of the minute she walks through the door. Fernando assures Rosario that he will defend her honor. Upon this, Paquiro makes a spectacle of asking Rosario to dance, and Pepa questions his motives jealously. Fernando insults Paquiro honor, while Rosario protests. Paquiro suggests a duel to prove his valor. A brawl begins, the women holding back Paquiro and the men from rushing Fernando, and Rosario faints in the excitement. After setting the time and place of the duel, Fernando leaves with Rosario. Pepa, returning to the center of attention, engages the crowd in a fandango.\n Third Tableau\nLater that night, Rosario sits on a bench in the palace garden, listening to the sad song of a nightingale under the light of the moon. As she moves to go inside, Fernando approaches the house, calling to her. She responds sorrowfully, but always lovingly, and he doubts her claims of total devotion. They share a loving moment, ruined by the presence of Paquiro, who is dressed in a black cloak with Pepa trailing furtively. Fernando makes ready to leave, and Rosario clings to him, begging him to stay. Fernando tears himself away, promising to return victorious, and leaves. Rosario follows, and the duel begins. Two screams signal the end of the duel, one by Fernando being mortally wounded, the other by Rosario. Paquiro flees, dragging his cloak behind him. Rosario drags the mortally wounded Fernando to the bench where they had just shared their tender moment.

The villagers are dismayed by the arrival of Jontek and an unrecognisable woman, who turns out to be the saddened Halka. They are angry when they hear about Janusz's engagement and even angrier when they realise that Halka is pregnant. Halka is in a world of her own, crushed by grief and fixated on the images of the dove being broken by the falcon. A black raven passes overhead, boding ill for everyone.\n\tAct 4\n\tJontek is very sad about Halka. When a piper, in the village to play at the wedding of Janusz and Zofia, appears playing a happy tune, Jontek asks him what there is to be so happy about. The piper mollifies him by playing a haunting mountain song. Jontek describes his love for Halka and the many wonders of nature she reminds him of.\n\tWhen Janusz and Zofia arrive in the village to celebrate their wedding, the angry villagers have to be convinced to act festive by Dziemba, the steward, who persuades them to do so out of respect for the bride. Zofia notices that Halka is terribly upset. She thinks she has seen Halka somewhere before, and even asks her what's wrong. Janusz admits that Halka is the girl who interrupted their engagement party but whisks Zofia into the church before she can ask any more questions. Halka is heartbroken to see that Janusz is going through with the marriage. She has lost her baby and feels completely alone. In a fit of rage, she decides to burn down the church. However, she decides to let Janusz live and throws herself into the river instead."},{"opera_title":"Die Sch\u00f6ne Galathee","composer":"Franz von Supp\u00e9","synopsis":"The sculptor Pygmalion has fallen madly in love with his statue of Galath\u00e9e and accordingly does not want to sell it to Mydas, a patron of the arts. Instead he prays to Venus, the goddess of the love, that the statue be brought to life. The wish is granted but Galath\u00e9e turns out to be a very independent-minded creature. She is unfaithful to Pygmalion with his servant Ganymed (because he is much more pleasing to her than Pygmalion) and does not reject Mydas, who offers her jewelry. When Pygmalion catches Galath\u00e9e in a compromising situation, he successfully implores Venus to turn her back into stone. The jewelry offered by Mydas is also turned into stone, but the whole statue is sold to him."},{"opera_title":"Akhnaten","composer":"Philip Glass","synopsis":"The opera is divided into three acts:\n\tAct 1: Year 1 of Akhnaten's Reign in Thebes\n\tPrelude, Verse 1, Verse 2, Verse 3\n\tSet in the key of A minor, the strings introduce a ground bass theme, with following variations. (A passacaglia). The scribe recites funeral texts from the pyramids. 'Open are the double doors of the horizon; unlocked are its bolts.'\n\tScene 1: Funeral of Akhnaten's father Amenhotep III\n\tHeralded by hammering drums, Aye and a small male chorus chant a funeral hymn in Egyptian, later joined by the full chorus. The music is basically a march, based on the chords of A major and F\u00e2\u2122\u00af minor (with added major sixth), and grows to ecstatic intensity towards the end.\n\tScene 2: The Coronation of Akhnaten\n\tAfter a lengthy orchestral introduction, during which Akhnaten appears, heralded by a solo trumpet, the High Priest, Aye, and Horemhab sing a ritual text. After that, the Narrator recites a list of royal titles bestowed upon Akhnaten, while he is crowned. After the coronation, the chorus repeats the ritual text from the beginning of the scene. Again, the main key is A minor.\n\tScene 3: The Window of Appearances\n\tAfter an introduction in A minor, dominated by tubular bells, Akhnaten sings a praise to the Creator (in Egyptian) at the window of public appearances. This is the first time he actually sings, after he has already been on stage for 20 minutes, and the effect of his countertenor voice (which in 1983 was even more rare than nowadays) is startling. He is joined by Nefertiti, who actually sings lower notes than he, and later by Queen Tye, whose soprano soars high above the intertwining voices of the royal couple.\n\tAct 2: Years 5 to 15 in Thebes and Akhetaten\n\tScene 1: The Temple\n\tThe scene opens again in A minor, with the High Priest and a group of priests singing a hymn to Amun, principal god of the old order, in his temple. The music becomes increasingly dramatic, as Akhnaten, together with Queen Tye and his followers, attack the temple. This scene has only wordless singing. The harmonies grow very chromatic, finally reaching A flat major and E minor. The temple roof is removed and the sun god Aten's rays invade the temple, thus ending Amun's reign and laying the foundation for the worship of the only god Aten.\n\tScene 2: Akhnaten and Nefertiti\n\tTwo solo celli introduce a \"love theme\". Accompanied by a solo trombone while the harmony switches to H(sus), the Narrator recites a prayer-like poem to the sun god. The strings softly take over the music in E minor, and the same poem is recited again, this time actually as a love poem from Akhnaten to Nefertiti. Then Akhnaten and Nefertiti sing the same text to each other (in Egyptian), as an intimate love duet. After a while, the trumpet associated with Akhnaten joins them as the highest voice, turning the duet into a trio.\n\tScene 3: The City - Dance\n\tThe Narrator speaks a text taken from the boundary stones of the new capital of the empire, Akhet-Aten (The Horizon of Aten), describing the construction of the city, with large, light-filled spaces. After a brass fanfare, the completion of the city is celebrated in a light-hearted dance, contrasting with the stark, ritualistic music with which this act began. (In the Stuttgart premiere, the dance actually described the construction of the city)\n\tScene 4: Hymn\n\tWhat now follows is a hymn to the only god Aten, a long aria (alternating between A minor and A major) by Akhnaten, and the central piece of the opera. It is outstanding as it is the only text sung in the language of the audience, praising the sun giving life to everything. After the aria, an off-stage chorus sings Psalm 104 in Hebrew, dating some 400 years later, which has strong resemblances to Akhnaten's Hymn, thus emphasizing Akhnaten as the first founder of a monotheistic religion.\n\tAct 3: Year 17 and the Present\n\tScene 1: The Family\n\tTwo Oboe d'amore play the \"love theme\" from Act II. We see Akhnaten, with Nefertiti and their six daughters, singing wordlessly in contemplation. It is obvious that they are oblivious of what happens outside of the palace. As the music switches from E minor to F minor, the Narrator reads letters from Syrian vassals, asking for help against their enemies. Since the king does not send troops, his land is being seized and plundered by their enemies. The scene focuses again on Akhnaten and his family, still oblivious of the country falling apart.\n\tScene 2: The Attack and Fall of the City\n\tThe music moves again to a vigorous F minor. Horemhab, Aye and the High Priest of Aten instigate the people (as the chorus), singing part of the aforementioned letters (in their original Akkadian language) until finally the palace is attacked, the royal family killed, and the city of the sun destroyed.\n\tScene 3: The Ruins\n\tThe music of the very beginning of the opera returns. The scribe recites an inscription on Aye's tomb, praising the death of \"the heretic\" and the new reign of the old gods. He then describes the restoration of Amun's temple by Akhnaten's son Tutenkhamun. The Prelude music grows stronger and the scene is moved to present-day Egypt, to the ruins of Amarna, the former capital Akhet-Aton. The Narrator appears as a modern tourist guide and speaks a text from a guide book, describing the ruins. \"There is nothing left of this glorious city of temples and palaces\".\n\tScene 4: Epilogue\n\tThe ghosts of Akhnaten, Nefertiti and Queen Tye appear, singing wordlessly amongst the ruins. The funeral procession from the beginning of the opera appears on the horizon, and they join it. The music introduces a bass line from the beginning of Einstein on the Beach, which is the first part of Glass' \"portrait\" trilogy (The second one being Satyagraha and the third one Akhnaten), thus providing a musical bracket for the whole trilogy."},{"opera_title":"Le Toreador","composer":"Adolphe Adam","synopsis":"Place: The garden of Don Belflor's house in Barcelona\n Act One\nCoraline, a former opera singer from Paris, is unhappily married to the retired bullfighter Don Belflor.

The two exchange love letters over the garden wall. Tracolin saves Don Belfor from an attack by ruffians and is invited into his house. He claims he is acting as a go-between for a dancer at the opera, Carit\u00e9a, who has fallen in love with Don Belflor. The old man is flattered but asks for further proof and Tracolin can think of no other recourse but to give him Coraline's letter. As Don Belflor is leaving for liaison with Carit\u00e9a, Coraline accuses him of adultery. In his confusion Don Belflor drops the letter on the floor. The horrified Coraline believes that she has been found out.\n Act Two\nCoraline cannot understand why Don Belfor has not reacted angrily to the contents of the letter. Tracolin climbs over the garden wall and tells her he has been in love with her since they met at the opera. He reveals the details of her husband's adultery then leaves the garden. When Don Belflor returns, Coraline again accuses him of infidelity. He admits the truth when she mentions the name \"Carit\u00e9a\" and begs for her forgiveness.

He muses sadly on Donna Diana's coldness, which all his victories fail to overcome. Perrin the clown takes pity on him, and gives him the advice to return coldness for coldness. Don Cesar promises to try this, though it seems hard to hide his deep love. Floretta, Donna Diana's foster-sister enters to announce the result of the tournament. She flirts with Perrin, to whom she is attached, but he turns a cold shoulder to her and she departs in a rage, though he is head over heels in love with her.\nThe next scene opens on a brilliant crowd, welcoming Count Sovereign of Barcelona and his daughter Donna Diana. The Count greets them graciously, and making sign to the three gallant Princes, Don Cesar of Urgel, Don Louis of Bearne and Gaston Count de Foie, they advance to receive their laurels on bended knee from the Princess, who crowns Cesar with a golden wreath, while the two other princes each win a silver prize. When the ceremony is over, Don Diego turns to his daughter, asking her to choose a husband and give an heir to the country, but Diana declares that love seems like poison to her, and marriage death. Gaston and Louis, nothing daunted, determine to try their luck, and while the father prays to God to soften his daughter's heart, Cesar's courage sinks ever lower. Donna Diana alone is cool and calm, inwardly resolved to keep her hand and heart free. She is envied by her two cousins Fenisa and Laura, who would gladly choose one of the gallant warriors. Perrin now advises the Princes to try their wit and gallantry on the Princess. Gaston begins to plead his cause, declaring, that he will not leave Barcelona without a bride and Louis follows his example; both are greatly admired and applauded by the assistants, but Diana finds their compliments ridiculous and their wit shallow. Cesar without a word retires to the background, and when asked by the Princess why he does not compete with his rivals, answers \"Because I will not love, nor ever wish to be loved; I only woo you, to show you my regard.\" Greatly mortified, Diana resolves to punish his pride.\n Act 2\nA ball is going on in the Prince's gardens. Each of the ladies has a bunch of different coloured ribbons, and decides to get the man she loves for her own. Diana explains that each knight is to choose a colour, which entitles him to own the lady wearing that colour, as long as the masquerade lasts. Don Louis choosing green gets Donna Laura, Don Gaston wearing red is chosen by Fenisa; Perrin loudly asserting that, abhorring love he chooses the obscure colour black, wins Floretta, and Don Cesar choosing white, finds himself Donna Diana's champion. She takes his arm, and her beauty so arouses him, that forgetting himself, he confesses his love. Triumphant but mocking, she turns from him. In a bantering tone he asks her, if she really believed, that his entreaties were real?\nFurious at being so easily duped she bids him leave her, and when alone resolves to have revenge. She calls Perrin to fetch her cousins, and charges him to let Cesar know that he can hear her sing in the gardens. Adorned with beautiful garments and surrounded by her attendants, she plays and sings sweetly as soon as she hears Don Cesar's steps. But he wanders in the grounds, admiring the plants, to all appearance deaf to beauty and song. Impatiently Diana signals to Floretta to let Cesar know, that he is in the presence of his Princess, at which, as awaking from a dream, Cesar bows to the Princess and excuses himself, leaving Diana in despair.\n Act 3\nPerrin gives vent to his feelings of love for Floretta, and about the Princess, whose state of mind he guesses. He is delighted to see his scheme successful, and sings a merry air, overheard by Diana. Offstage Don Louis is heard, serenading Donna Laura, while Don Gaston sings Fenisa's praise, so that poor Diana is surrounded by loving couples, who shamelessly carry on their courting before her very eyes, and then retire casting mischievous glances at their disgusted mistress.\nDiana sees Cesar approaching and determines to try again to in order to humble his pride. She explains that she has resolved to yield to her father, and give her hand to Prince Louis. For a moment Cesar stands petrified, but Perrin whispers not to believe in women's wiles. So he controls himself once more, congratulates her, wishing the same courtesy from the Princess, because, as he calmly adds, he has become betrothed to Donna Laura.\nThat is the last straw for Diana. Her reserve vanishes when her secret love for the hero, which she has not even admitted to herself, is in danger. She breaks down, and is found by her father, who enters, loudly acknowledging Don Louis as his son-in-law, and sanctioning Don Cesar's choice of Donna Laura. But Cesar begs to receive his bride from Diana's own hands, at which the latter rising slowly, asks her father, if he is still willing to leave to her alone the selection of a husband. Don Diego granting this, she answers: \"Then I choose him who conquered pride through pride.\" \"And who may this happy mortal be?\" says Cesar. \"You ask? It's you, my tyrant,\" she replies, and sinks into her lover's arms."},{"opera_title":"Tsaar Saltan","composer":"Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov","synopsis":"Place: Partly in the city of Tmutarakan and partly on the island of Buyan\n\tPrologue\n\tOn a wintry evening three sisters are sitting at spinning wheels.

Severin is making off with a pineapple when he is shot and wounded by Olim, a provincial policeman.

He pretends to try to catch them, but is philosophical when they run off laughing. His daughter, the water nymph Rusalka, confesses that she wants to become human, because mortals have souls which are denied to the fairy world, and because she has fallen in love with a mortal who often swims in the lake. Grieving, but realising that there is no turning back for her, he advises her to consult the witch Jezibaba. Rusalka calls on the moon to tell her love she is waiting for him, then calls Jezibaba, whose cottage is beside the lake. First giving her the ability to walk on land, the witch asks what she will give to become human. She is unimpressed by Rusalka's offer of all that she has, telling her that she will have to be mute when among humans. She also warns that if her love is not returned, her lover will share eternal damnation with her. Rusalka is confident that her human soul and her love will be strong enough to prevail. They go into the cottage, where Jezibaba brews the potion.\nMorning approaches and the Prince's hunting party draws near the lake, in pursuit of an elusive white doe. The Prince, commenting that the woods are full of magic, sends his followers home and sits by the lake. Rusalka appears before him, dressed like a waif. The Prince wonders if she is woman or fairy tale and asks if she is kin to the white doe. She is unable to reply and he declares that her lips will at least respond to his kiss. When he asks if she loves him she flings herself into his arms, as her sisters and father lament. The Prince takes her with him.\nACT II\nA week later, a park surrounding the Prince's castle.\nIn the background a gallery and banquet hall. In the foreground a pond. The kitchen boy explains to the gamekeeper that the Prince has found a strange creature in the woods and is likely to marry her. The gamekeeper confirms that the woods are full of sinister magic. The kitchen boy worries that the Prince has changed, walks round in a daze, and has resisted the parson's attempts to warn him of danger. The only hope is that he is supposed to be fickle and is apparently turning his attentions to a visiting foreign princess.\nThey run off as Rusalka, beautifully dressed but sad and pale, approaches with the Prince, who complains that he has yet to fathom her mystery and reproaches her for not responding to the warmth of his passion. The Foreign Princess is jealous of the Prince's love for Rusalka, and detaches him from her by reminding him of his duties as her host. They leave to prepare for a ball and the Water Gnome emerges from the pond, lamenting that his daughter has left her home and fearing that she will be unhappy. At the ball the Prince courts the Foreign Princess and neglects Rusalka, who runs out to her father lamenting that the Prince has left her for another. Now neither a fairy nor a woman, she can neither live nor die. The Princess rejoices in the change that has come over the Prince now that he is courting her. He swears that he prefers her warmth to Rusalka's pallid coldness, but the Princess taunts him with not knowing which he prefers. When he declares that he loves only her, Rusalka flings herself desperately into his arms, but he pushes her away, terrified by her icy coldness. The Water Gnome pulls Rusalka into the pond and the confused Prince begs the Princess for help against the powers of magic, but she derisively tells him to join his beloved in hell, and leaves.\nACT III\nThe glade by the lake\nRusalka laments her fate, cut off from her sisters and rejected by the Prince.

She has been betrothed to the foppish Prince Paul but does not find him to her liking and, owing to her being in an unhappy state of mind over the affair, the Baron generates a war to amuse her. She decides to review her troops. There is a roll of drums, and the cry is started that the enemy is advancing, but it turns out to be her Highness.\nThis visit proves fateful, for she falls desperately in love with the manly, handsome soldier Fritz, whose main passions in life are his love for the pretty Wanda and his hatred of General Boum. The Duchess immediately makes Fritz a corporal, and as she grows more and more delighted with him, he is promoted rapidly to sergeant, lieutenant and captain. Finally, to spite the General, she makes him commander-in-chief and sends him to conquer the enemy.\n Act 2\nFritz wins the battle easily by making the whole opposing army drunk, his artillery consisting of 300,000 well-filled bottles. When he returns, crowned with victory, the delighted Duchess finds herself more enamored of him than ever, and hints at the possibility of his receiving other honors. However, she finds him a great blockhead in the matter, for he shows that he prefers his Wanda to such distinctions, and he incurs the Duchess's great displeasure by asking permission to marry Wanda at once. This proves the death-blow to the Duchess' devotion, and she conspires to assassinate Fritz upon his return from the wedding ceremony.\n Act 3\nWhen everything is ready for the bloody deed, however, the Duchess changes her mind, which is now busied with a new affair with the Baron Grog. Her love life seems to be forever ill-starred, however, for this latest romance is blighted by the news that her beloved has a wife and four children. The Duchess becomes philosophic and decides to marry her original betrothed, Prince Paul, after all. To quote her own words, \"What can one do? If you can't have those you could love, you must try to love those you can have.\"\nInstead of assassinating Fritz, the Duchess devises the lesser punishment of noisy serenades during his wedding night, and then hurries him off on a false alarm to fight the enemy. The enemy proves to be a jealous husband who mistakes him for another man and gives him a caning. Fritz is stripped of his military ranks, but he can now leave the army, return to Wanda, and become a village schoolmaster, albeit a rather illiterate one.

Its themes include revenge, lust, lost love, devotion, and eventually, reconciliation.\n Act 1\nThe action opens with Tolomeo on the beach of Cyprus, where he meets his shipwrecked brother, Alessandro. Alessandro has come under orders from Cleopatra to kill his own flesh and blood. Tolomeo becomes aware of Alessandro's identity and is tempted to kill him, but can't bring himself to do so. Tolomeo (going under the name of Osmin to protect himself from the wrath of King Araspe, an ally of Cleopatra) hides, and Elisa, sister of the king, turns up. Alessandro wakes, thinks she is like a goddess, and declares his love for her. She, however, loves \"Osmin.\" She is very flirtatious. But as she and \"Osmin\" talk, it becomes clear that her feelings are not requited, that Tolomeo loves another (Seleuce, his wife, who he thinks is lost). Alone, he considers taking his own life.\nWe are then introduced to Seleuce who is also going under an alias, \"Delia.\" She sings of her dispossession, then sees Tolomeo on the shore, but she runs away when Araspe arrives. Araspe is furious at Seleuce, whom he pursues with amorous intent. Act One closes with Tolomeo visualising his wife, wishing that she could appear before him and ease his pain.\n Act 2\nTolomeo loses his temper and declares to Elisa that he is not \"Osmin\" but is indeed the deposed joint ruler of Egypt. Elisa tells the resentful Araspe to bring \"Delia\" before them. This is done and Tolomeo rapturously declares his love to Seleuce. She, in order to protect Tolomeo pretends she doesn't know what he is talking about, while in typical operatic fashion voicing her inner thoughts in parenthesis; how this deception is painful to her and she longs for her husband.\nTolomeo reiterates that he cannot love Elisa and she rages at this. Tolomeo leaves and Alessandro enters, reiterating his love for Elisa. Elisa claims that the only way she can love him in return is if he murders his brother. Seleuce sings another lament and Tolomeo echoes her words in the background. Araspe bursts onto the scene and tries to rape Seleuce. Tolomeo can't bear the sight and rushes to defend his wife. He reveals their true identities, and Araspe (the baritone) sings ruggedly of how he will punish the lovers. The couple are left alone at the end of act two and touchingly sing synchronised for the first time of how their love for one another will doom them both.\n Act 3\nAlessandro has a letter positing the death of Cleopatra. He says she has paid the price for her cruelty. Somehow Araspe interprets Alessandro saying he wants to go home to Egypt with Tolomeo as meaning he wants his brother slain, but wants someone else to do it. Araspe, of course, thinks himself the very man for the job and delights in avenging the jealousy he feels.\nElisa forces Seleuce to cede Tolomeo to her, saying he'll die otherwise. Tolomeo rejects Elisa once more. She says if he is so brave and intent on rejecting her, then he should drink some poison. This he does. He describes the effect the poison is having, and then, apparently, dies. Alessandro comes to the desperate Seleuce in the remotest part of the wood and promises to reunite her with Tolomeo. Araspe triumphanly reveals the body of Tolomeo to Alessandro. He is sure that Seleuce is his but Elisa reveals the potion was actually a sleeping draught and she will torture Seleuce and put her to death. At this point Tolomeo wakes up and Alessandro presents Seleuce to him. Husband and wife are reunited. The opera ends with a joyous quartet expounding that when suffering turns into joy, all can be forgiven."},{"opera_title":"Jolie fille de Perth","composer":"Georges Bizet","synopsis":"Place: PerthTime: 14th century\n\tAct 1\n\tThe workshop of Henry Smith the armourer\n\tWorkmen sing in the forge, on the eve of the Carnival.

Asdrubale himself is deeply attracted to Clarice, but being pursued by three women at the same time, he is uncertain that he can trust any one of them. Furthermore Clarice is hotly pursued by the Count's friend Giocondo and which of the two men she prefers is far from clear.\nAsdrubale enlists the help of his majordomo Fabrizio to test the genuineness of the ladies' emotions. When most of the guests happen to be together with the Count, Fabrizio produces an urgent letter which has apparently just arrived. On opening it Asdrubale reacts with a convincing show of horror and despair at its contents before hurrying away to his private rooms.\nNews rapidly spreads amongst the guests that the Count has been ruined. Fulvia and Aspasia cannot wait to leave, feeling that they have had a lucky escape. However, the arrival of an exotic oriental potentate is announced. He is Asdrubale's creditor, and in consequence now the owner of all of his property and possessions. Immediately most of the house guests transfer their attentions and flattery to the new arrival, failing to recognize that it is Asdrubale in heavy disguise and using a ridiculous fake accent.\nOnly Giocondo and Clarice demonstrate any concern for the Count. When he is finally persuaded to leave his private rooms (the \"wealthy oriental creditor\" having departed) they promise their continued loyalty and financial support. The other guests decline to offer any tangible help. At that moment Fabrizio bursts in and announces that Asdrubale's debts have miraculously been cleared and that he is once again a wealthy man. The general rejoicing contrasts with the consternation amongst those guests who realize that they have been tricked into revealing their falseness and base motives to the Count.\n Act 2\nRecriminations amongst the guests are rife. Fulvia and Aspasia urge Pacuvio and Macrobio to extract revenge on the Count and Giocondo by challenging them to a duel. Fortunately inherent cowardice prevails and by bluster and outright lying on the part of Pacuvio, confrontation is avoided.\nAsdrubale invites his guests to go hunting and Pacuvio further demonstrates his cowardly nature by panicking when a storm blows up and losing his gun and other possessions in a headlong dash back to the villa. Meanwhile Giocondo is continuing his amorous pursuit of Clarice, who is flattered by the young man's attentions and, although she loves the Count, offers no objections to Giocondo continuing his flirtatious advances. This last part of the conversation is overheard by Macrobio, who takes great delight in repeating it to the Count. Naturally, Asdrubale's jealousy flares up, much to Clarice's annoyance.\nClarice decides that, as her love has been tested by the Count, she will test him in return. She informs him that her twin brother has just returned from military service and is coming to the villa to find her.\nWord of the fictional duel in which they had both apparently been humiliated has now reached the Count and Giocondo, and they are determined on revenge. They corner Macrobio and force him to admit that he is a pathetic, ignorant coward. Having achieved this groveling surrender, all is forgiven and forgotten.\nClarice enters disguised as her twin, complete with a retinue of soldiers. \"He\" announces that he has had \"his sister\" taken away and the Count will never see her again. Asdrubale is distraught and once again locks himself in his private rooms, threatening suicide. As a final act he asks Fabrizio to deliver a note to the young officer for Clarice, regretting his ridiculous jealousy. Clarice realizes that she has achieved her victory and sends the note back with her signature on it. The Count recognizes the signature and comes rushing from his rooms.\nTo general amazement Clarice throws off her disguise and the lovers are finally reconciled.

Frasquita tells him that Lukas is asleep, which Repela is interested to know. He runs off to tell his master that Frasquita is apparently alone.\n\tScene 4: The Corregidor approaches Frasquita, who flirts with him and dances a fandango. He is afraid that her dancing might wake Lukas. She threatens to wake Lukas (with the song \"In dem Schatten meiner Locken\" from the Spanisches Liederbuch), but relents when the Corregidor urges her not to. The Corregidor is so taken by Frasquita that he is dumbstruck for a moment. He begins to woo her, and she seizes the opportunity to press for a favor she has obviously already requested many times: the appointment of her nephew as court notary in the nearby town of Estella. The Corregidor refuses, and his advances become ever more ardent. In his passion, he loses his balance and crashes to the ground. Lukas takes this cue to reveal himself. The couple ridicules the old man, who, realizing that Lukas has heard the entire exchange, childishly vows his revenge. Frasquita offers him some grapes in order to placate him, but he hesitates.\n\tScene 5: Repela, who has also been watching the entire scene, enters, intending to reprimand Frasquita for her behaviour. He is interrupted by the sound of the Bishop's arrival in the distance. Lukas and Frasquita rush off to finish their preparations, while the Corregidor sends Repela off to set his revenge plan in motion. The Bishop approaches amid an onstage brass fanfare.\n\tAct 2\n\tScene 1: In the kitchen at the millhouse, Lukas and Frasquita are eating dinner and discussing, first teasingly, then passionately, how happy they are together. They are interrupted by a knock at the door. It is Tonuelo, one of the Alkalde's servants, coming under the banner of the \"rule of law.\" He is very, very drunk.\n\tScene 2: Tonuelo summons Lukas to the Alkalde, the local mayor. Lukas says he will go in the morning, but Tonuelo insists that he come immediately. Frasquita wishes to accompany him, but Tonuelo again relays that he is to summon Lukas only. The two men exit, leaving Frasquita alone.\n\tScene 3: Frasquita begins to tidy up the dishes. She then sits down to her spinning wheel and muses to herself about Tonuelo's summons. From outside, she hears a sudden shout for help. Thinking it is Lukas, she rushes to the door, only to discover that it is the Corregidor, who has fallen into the millstream.\n\tScene 4: The Corregidor enters the house, soaking wet from the stream. Frasquita becomes angry, realizing at once what the Corregidor has intended all along. He attempts to bribe Frasquita into bed with her nephew's appointment, and when she refuses, he threatens her with a pistol. She in turn pulls out a blunderbuss, at which point the Corregidor is so overcome with fright that he becomes faint. He asks her to call Repela.\n\tScene 5: Repela enters to tend to the Corregidor, while Frasquita prepares to leave on the pretense of summoning a doctor from town. In reality, she leaves to find Lukas and to inform the Corregidora of what her husband is up to.\n\tScene 6: The Corregidor removes his wet clothes, instructing Repela to hang them by the fire to dry. Realizing that Frasquita is no longer there, he sends Repela off to intercept her before she reaches town. The Corregidor, alone, sings to himself about the strange behaviour of women.\n\tAt this point, the curtain drops, and the orchestra plays some brief scene-change music.\n\tScene 7: The Alkalde and his servants Manuela and Pedro are drinking together. Lukas and Tonuelo enter through a rear door.\n\tScene 8: The revelers drink to Lukas, even though he is clearly not in the mood to be trifled with. Lukas tricks the group into a drinking game, then pretends to go to sleep on a bench. The drunken servants go off to find their own beds.\n\tScene 9: Lukas, enraged, gets up and escapes out of the window.\n\tScene 10: After a few moments, Manuela enters the room to ask Lukas to hire her away from the Alkalde. Realizing that Lukas is no longer there, she rouses the rest of the household.\n\tScene 11: Pedro and Tonuelo join Manuela, and the three reluctantly go out to search for Lukas.\n\tAct 3\n\tScene 1: Frasquita makes her way to the Alkalde's house to find Lukas. Unbeknownst to either, Lukas passes her on his way back to the mill. She speaks to herself nervously. Repela enters, but Frasquita does not notice him yet.\n\tScene 2: Repela reveals himself. He mocks Frasquita, and she yells at him. They decide to go off together in search of Lukas. This is followed by another episode of scene-change music.\n\tScene 3: Lukas arrives back at the mill. He notices the Corregidor's clothes still hanging by the fire and the notary appointment on the table, and jumps to the obvious conclusion. Grabbing the blunderbuss, he creeps towards the bedroom door. Seeing the Corregidor asleep on the bed, Lukas berates himself quietly in a fit of humiliation and jealousy. Suddenly realizing that the Corregidor also has a pretty wife, he forms his own plan for vengeance. Donning the Corregidor's clothes and laughing, Lukas heads for the Corregidor's house.\n\tScene 4: The Corregidor, awoken by Lukas, cautiously comes out of the bedroom. Vexed that his own clothes have apparently been stolen, he puts on those that Lukas left behind. The Alkalde enters with Frasquita, Tonuelo and Repela, but they do not yet notice the Corregidor, who tries to slip back into the bedroom.\n\tScene 5: The Alkalde notices the Corregidor, but thinking he is Lukas, orders Tonuelo to apprehend him. Tonuelo knocks the Corregidor to the ground, but the group quickly realizes their mistake. After Repela divines Lukas's intent in stealing the Corregidor's clothes, everyone agrees to head off to the Corregidor's house.\n\tAct 4\n\tScene 1: In front of the Corregidor's house, a night watchman announces 5:30 AM.\n\tScene 2: The Corregidor, Frasquita, Repela, Tonuelo and the Alkalde arrive at the Corregidor's house. They knock, but there is no reply. Repela, making light of the situation, pretends that he is serenading the house by faking the sound of a guitar. Finally the Duenna wakes up and comes to the window. The Corregidor announces his presence, but the Duenna does not believe him, saying that the lord of the house is already home. Realizing who that must be, Frasquita despairs that Lukas did indeed think her unfaithful. The Corregidor does not understand what is going on.\n\tScene 3: A troop of officers and servants bursts out of the gate and start to beat the party. They try to run away and explain their presence at the same time. The chorus of soldiers sings confusedly. The Corregidor still does not understand what is going on.\n\tScene 4: Donna Mercedes, the Corregidora, appears in the plaza. Although she has already sized up the situation, she continues to treat her husband as if he were Lukas. The Corregidor, finally realizing what is going on, attempts to blame Frasquita for everything that has happened, but his wife does not let him get away with it.\n\tScene 5: Lukas enters, still dressed in the Corregidor's clothes and imitating the Corregidor's mannerisms. After everyone's true identity is revealed, the characters recap the story and explain what happened when Lukas arrived in disguise at the Corregidor's house (Wolf cut most of this section in his 1897 revision). Lukas and Frasquita are reconciled, and the Corregidor gives way, realizing that he has been bested. The ensemble thanks the Corregidora with respect and gratitude for her benevolent intervention."},{"opera_title":"Don Sebastie Portugal","composer":"Gaetano Donizetti","synopsis":"Time: 16th centuryPlace: Lisbon and Morocco\n Act 1\nLisbon\nThe Christian king, Dom S\u00e9bastian, leaves his uncle Dom Antonio to rule Portugal while he goes on a crusade against the Moors of Africa. S\u00e9bastian's entourage includes the idealistic poet Camo\u00ebns and the Moor princess Zayda, whom he had rescued from being burnt at stake for trying to escape the monastery she had resided in since her conversion to Christianity (O mon Dieu, sur la terre). He intends to return her to her father Ben-Selim.\n Act 2\nFez, Morocco\nThe reunion between Zayda and Ben-Selim is dampened by her refusal to marry the Moorish chief Abayaldos.\nA battlefield in Morocco\nAbayaldos has led the Moors to battle against S\u00e9bastian's forces and mostly wiped them out. The wounded S\u00e9bastian's life is saved only when his lieutenant Dom Henrique presents himself to Abayaldos as S\u00e9bastian, before expiring from his own wounds, and Zayda pleads for \"the Christian's\" life (the real S\u00e9bastian) in return for her consent to marry Abayaldos, reasoning that her life was saved by a Christian during her captivity in Portugal and that the favor must be returned. S\u00e9bastian is left on the battlefield a broken man (Seul sur la terre).\n Act 3\nA public square, Lisbon\nCamo\u00ebns has survived the battle and returned to Lisbon (O Lisbonne, o ma patrie!) where he learns that Antonio has aligned himself with the Spanish Grand Inquisitor Dom Juan de Sylva and usurped the throne.

Camo\u00ebns causes a commotion in his outrage, and S\u00e9bastian is recognized by the people when he intervenes.

The oracle-like Omniscient Mussel tells her that though Poseidon is far away, he remains steadfast in his love for her. The Mussel then tells of a ship on which the most beautiful woman in the world, Helena (Helen of Troy), is about to be murdered by her husband, Menelas (Menelaus). To save the woman, Aithra conjures a flash storm to shipwreck the passengers, who soon make their way ashore and appear at the palace. Helena has been trying to save her marriage, but Menelas cannot forgive her for her betrayal with Paris at the start of the Trojan War. Bitterly, he has prevented their daughter, Hermione, from knowing her own mother. On land, Menelas once again plans to stab his wife, but the sight of her beauty by moonlight makes him hesitate. To ensure that he doesn't kill her, Aithra invokes elves to torment him; they make him believe that his rival, Paris, is present, and he rushes out to confront the specter. Aithra's magic then helps Helena regain her original youthful beauty, and a lotus drink banishes her anxiety. Servant girls take her to another room.\nWhen Menelas stumbles back in, raving about having surprised and killed Helena and Paris, Aithra gives him the soothing drink as well. Hearing of his conflicted emotions toward his wife, the sorceress tries to tell him that nine years before, when he lost Helena to Paris, the gods actually substituted a wraith to fool Paris; the real Helena was hidden in the castle of Aithra's father on the slopes of the Atlas Mountains. There she remains, asleep, waiting for her husband to wake her; the woman in the next room is the wraith. Aithra pledges to transport Menelas by magic to the castle. Bewildered and hesitant, he gradually yields to the notion that the original Helena will be restored to him. In a pavilion at the foot of the mountain, the two can be reunited. Aithra suggests he use the lotus potion to keep disturbing memories at bay.\n Act 2\nIn the pavilion, Helena awakens and hails the couple's second wedding night (\"Zweite Brautnacht\"). Menelas, also awakening, still mistrusts his senses. His wife tries to soothe him with more lotus juice, but he catches sight of his sword, which revives jarring memories. Is this woman real or an illusion? Desert horsemen appear, and Altair, prince of the mountains, bows before Helena, offering gifts; his son Da-ud joins in praising her beauty. The scene reminds Menelas of a Trojan celebration in honor of Helena, but he tries to conceal his jealousy as Altair and Da-ud invite him to join a hunting party. Bidding farewell to Helena, and still uncertain of her identity, he leaves for the hunt. Aithra appears as one of the serving girls and cautions Helena that one of the vials she has packed contains a potion of forgetfulness but the other a potion of recollection. Against Aithra's strong advice Helena declares that recollection will be necessary to save her marriage; the fantasy of returning to an unblemished past is not a genuine solution.\nAt a sign from Helena, the maidservants withdraw when Altair returns, paying bold court to her and inviting her to a banquet in her honor. Even when word arrives that Menelas has killed Da-ud during the hunt, Altair continues his suit. He steps away, though, when the youth's body is brought in, followed by Menelas, who remains confused, thinking it is Paris he has killed. Again defying Aithra's counsel, Helena orders the potion of recollection prepared as time for the feast draws near. Menelas now imagines that the real Helena has died, and he resolves to join her in death; the Helena before him is surely the wraith. When he takes what he thinks is the potion of death, however, he sees the dead Helena as the living one: both are united. Altair and his cohorts seize and separate the couple, but Aithra reveals a phalanx of Poseidon's soldiers, who are escorting the child Hermione. Recognizing Aithra the sorceress, Altair bows to her power. Hermione, reunited at last with her parents, will go home with them to begin their life together."},{"opera_title":"A Quiet Place","composer":"Leonard Bernstein","synopsis":"Prologue: A chorus sings phrases such as \"My Heart Shall Be Thy Garden\", \"Cakes and Friends We Choose With Care\", and \"Lost Time is Never Found\". Some of these are repeated throughout the opera. Meanwhile, Voices are heard in reaction to a car accident. The victim is Dinah, a wife and mother of two.\nAct 1: Friends and family gather at Dinah's funeral. Among the guests are Dinah's brother (Bill), her best friend (Susie), her analyst, her family doctor and his wife (Doc and Mrs. Doc), and eventually her children (Dede and Junior). Sam, Dinah's widowed husband, stands immobile and isolated in a corner. People are absorbed in their own thoughts and aren't communicating well. In a series of fragmented conversations they discuss the circumstances of Dinah's death (the car accident from the prologue), mourn her loss and reveal some of what has happened to her family over the years. Dede and Junior live in Quebec with a French Canadian, Fran\u00e7ois, who has been romantically involved with Junior and is now married to Dede. Junior, who has a history of mental illness, has not seen his father in nearly 20 years, and Sam has never met his son-in-law. When everyone except Junior has arrived, the funeral director announces a ceremony of readings and reminiscences. Doc reads from Proverbs, Mrs. Doc from Elizabeth Barrett Browning (lines chosen by Sam); Bill and Susie offer spirited reminiscences of Dinah; Dede reads from Kahlil Gibran - until she breaks down in tears and Fran\u00e7ois must read for her. Junior's unruly entrance interrupts the ceremony, and no one greets him. At the conclusion of the readings the guests file past Dinah's coffin and depart, leaving Sam, Junior, Dede, and Fran\u00e7ois facing one another for the first time. Sam's first words are to Junior but give way to an explosion of 30 years' anger, reprisal and confused grief directed at all three young people. Sam breaks down crying, but no one goes to him. In a trio of reminiscence, Junior, Dede, and Fran\u00e7ois recall - via half-remembered letters home - a long-ago time when they were close with their fathers. Junior breaks the spell of remembering with a snap and accosts his father violently. He starts to rhyme - a symptom of his psychosis - and goads Sam with and improvised strip blues. They come to blows, and the coffin lid is knocked shut with a crash. Sam exits furiously, then Dede and Fran\u00e7ois. Junior, alone, becomes aware of his disarray and tenderly runs his hand across his mother's coffin.\nAct 2 (Incorporating Trouble in Tahiti):\nScene 1: At home later that evening, Sam is alone in the master bedroom. Reading Dinah's old diaries makes him angry, but he also feels love for Dinah and realizes that he misses her. The diary evokes a memory of 30 years ago...\nScene 2:...as a jazz trio advertises the charms of ideal family life in 1950s Suburbia, U.S.A. In their little white house Young Sam and Dinah quarrel at breakfast. Every day, it's the same. After ten years of marriage, they wish they could be kind to each other, but there is no real communication between them. In his office Young Sam clinches a deal and makes a loan with his customary \u00e9lan. The trio extols his business acumen and big heart. On her psychiatrist's couch Dinah relates a dream; as she struggled to find her way out of a dying garden, a voice beckoned to her, promising that love would lead her to a quiet place. Young Sam calls his secretary to his office and asks her if he has ever made any passes at her. Young Sam and Dinah meet in the rain at lunchtime. They both pretend to have lunch dates then wonder why they lied. What has happened, they ask themselves, to dull their love? Can't they find their way back to the garden where they began?\nScene 3: Sam's reverie is interrupted when Dede comes shyly to visit him. As they go through cartons and clothes in Dinah's closet they start to reach out to each other. Next door in Junior's room, Francois confronts Junior with his behavior at the funeral parlor. Fran\u00e7ois' anger provokes a psychotic phase that takes Junior through some painful associations to an important revelation - that he loves and needs his father. Meanwhile, Dede has tried on a dress which vividly recalls to Sam the young Dinah. Father and daughter embrace, Junior collapses in Fran\u00e7ois' arms. Dede and Fran\u00e7ois meet in the hallway - she elated, he exhausted. Francois breaks down in her arms, overcome by the strain of the day, and Dede comforts him. He is moved by her strength and embraces her passionately. When they leave, Sam goes into Junior's room. He tries to kiss his sleeping son but can't yet: he's still too conflicted. He finds a trophy on a shelf which reawakens his memory...\nScene 4:...as the jazz trio sings of the suburban dream. That distant afternoon, rather than going to Junior's school play, Sam has competed for a handball trophy and won. As he showers he decides that there are some men, like himself, who are just born winners and some men who will never win. Also avoiding Junior's play, Dinah goes to a movie - a terrible technicolor musical called Trouble in Tahiti. She finds it awful and describes it frame by frame, but is increasingly caught up in the plot, especially the big escapist number \"Island Magic\". Suddenly she returns to reality and rushes home to make dinner. Sam approaches his front door that night with dread - even winners must pay through the nose. As the jazz trio sings of evening shadows and loved ones together, Sam and Dinah try to have a talk after dinner. This can't make any headway. Sam wearily suggests going to the movies - some new musical about Tahiti. Dinah agrees. Mourning the lost magic between them they seek out the bought-and-paid-for magic of the silver screen.\nOld Sam remembers...\nAct 3: Dede is up early the next morning, weeding in her mother's once splendid, now overgrown garden. She senses Dinah's presence and speaks to her, remembering when they were close. Junior, in high spirits, appears with breakfast. Brother and sister play games remembered from childhood and reenact their parents' quarrelsome breakfasts. Fran\u00e7ois joins them in the midst of a tag game, and in another trio of remembrance - for which time stands still - they relive the first meeting of Dede and Fran\u00e7ois some 10 years before. Now Sam appears in the garden an the game of tag resumes. It ends when Sam decides that rather than be tagged by Fran\u00e7ois, he will open his arms to him and welcome him to the family. Sam reads aloud from Dinah's diary. The last entry he reads starts everyone giggling, and they release some of their sadness in shared laughter. The kids tell Sam they are thinking of staying on a few days, and all four euphorically imagine the joys of being together - until a little disagreement becomes a vicious argument. At its climax Junior hurls Dinah's diary into the air, and everything they have achieved since the debacle at the funeral parlor falls down around them. They stop, their anger spent, and look at the pages of the diary scattered on the ground. Thinking of Dinah and of her words, the recognize, one by one, that they can learn to communicate - indeed, that they must - as difficult as it will be for them. They reach out to one another."},{"opera_title":"Le Heure Espagnolle","composer":"Maurice Ravel","synopsis":"Time:Place: The workshop of the clockmaker Torquemada in Toledo, Spain.\nThe opera takes place in 21 scenes, with an introduction.\nTorquemada is at work in his shop when the muleteer Ramiro stops by to have his watch fixed, so that he can fulfill his duties at collecting the town's post. It is Thursday, the day that Torquemada goes out to tend the municipal clocks, so Ramiro must wait. Torquemada's wife, Concepci\u00f3n, enters to complain that her husband hasn't yet moved a clock into her bedroom.

So she asks him to move a grandfather clock to her bedroom, which he agrees to do.\nMeanwhile, she waits for Gonzalve, a poet. He arrives, and is inspired to poetry, but not to lovemaking, where Concepci\u00f3n would prefer the latter. When Ramiro is about to return, she sends him back saying that she chose the wrong clock. She then has the idea of having Gonzalve hide in one clock so that Ramiro can carry him upstairs. After Gonzalve is concealed, Don I\u00f1igo, a banker and another of Concepci\u00f3n's gentleman friends, arrives. When Ramiro returns, she persuades him to carry up the clock with Gonzalve concealed in it, and she accompanies him.\nOn his own, Don I\u00f1igo conceals himself in another clock.

She and Don Inigo try to communicate, but Ramiro arrives back with the other clock. Don Inigo has hidden himself again, and Ramiro now carries up the clock with Don I\u00f1igo upstairs.\nWith Gonzalve now downstairs, Concepci\u00f3n tries to turn him away from poetry towards her, but Gonzalve is too absorbed to follow her lead. Ramiro returns, and Gonzalve must conceal himself again. He offers to take the second clock up again. Impressed by how easily Ramiro carries the clocks (and their load) upstairs, Concepci\u00f3n begins to be physically attracted to him.\nWith Gonzalve and Don I\u00f1igo now each stuck in clocks, Torquemada returns from his municipal duties.

He tries to persuade her to run off with him and she finally agrees to do so soon.\nScene 2: Inside Louise's place of work\nLouise is being teased by the other seamstresses for being in love. A band is heard outside and Julien sings a serenade. The girls admire him for his looks and voice. Louise quietly slips away - to run off with Julien.\n Act 3\nA cottage overlooking Paris\nThe act opens with the opera's most well known aria, \"Depuis le jour\"; the lovers have moved into a cottage overlooking Paris and in the aria she sings of her happiness with her new existence and with her lover. A long love duet ensues in which they sing of their love for each other and Paris. Many Bohemians enter and crown Louise Queen of Montmartre. The Noctambulist presides as the King of the Fools. Louise's mother appears and the festivities end. She tells Louise of her father's illness and that her father creeps into Louise's room in the middle of the night, even though they agreed to regard her as dead. Even Julien is moved, and he lets Louise leave on the promise she will return whenever she wishes.\n Act 4\nThe Parisian home of Louise's parents\nThe father has regained his health and spirits. He is working again, but has come to accept poverty in a philosophical way. His recovery can be attributed to the return of Louise, whom he takes into his arms and sings a lullaby. She is not comforted and longs to be with Julien again. A merry waltz is heard outside and Louise takes it up, singing madly of love and freedom. Her parents are shocked and her father becomes increasingly angry. He shouts at Louise and demands that she leave; if that is what she wants, let her go and dance and laugh! He begins to attack her, but the mother stands in the way. Louise runs from the room to go back to Julien. Only then does the father realise what he did. \"Louise, Louise!\" he calls. She is gone and in despair he shakes his fist at the city that stole his daughter, \"Paris!\" he moans and the opera closes."},{"opera_title":"Antigona","composer":"Tommaso Traette","synopsis":"Antigone cremates Polynices by night.

The Philosopher, Ch\u00e9rubin's teacher, announces to the servants that there will be celebrations to mark this event. The Duke and the Baron reveal that Ch\u00e9rubin has invited the famous Spanish dancer L'Ensoleillad to the party. Nina, the Countess's maid, confesses to the Philosopher that she loves Ch\u00e9rubin.\nCh\u00e9rubin arrives, greeting the men, kissing the hands of the women, and secretly slipping a love letter to the Countess. When the guests leave to celebrate, Ch\u00e9rubin tells the Philosopher that he is in love with both L'Ensoleillad and the Countess. Suddenly, the Count storms in and threatens to kill Ch\u00e9rubin because he just discovered the secret love letter from the page to the Countess. Nina saves the page's life when she is able to recite all the verses of the love letter and claims that it was really written to her. Stupefied but calmed down, the Count apologizes to the Countess and they return to the banquet. The Philosopher remains to hear Ch\u00e9rubin proclaim once again that he loves both L'Ensoleillad and the Countess.\n Act 2\nAt an inn not far from the Count's castle, arriving travelers argue with the Innkeeper about securing rooms for the night, complaining about the low quality of the facilities. Even the Countess and the Baroness are not happy with what they have received. Soon officers arrive and want to celebrate Ch\u00e9rubin's recent commission. When Ch\u00e9rubin arrives, he flirts with the mistress of Captain Ricardo, and Ricardo challenges Ch\u00e9rubin to a duel. The sudden arrival of L'Ensoleillad postpones the duel, but not for long.

The Philosopher arrives and gives him a practical lesson on different fighting techniques, but is interrupted by the Innkeeper, who is horrified to see the combat. The Countess and the Baroness come from the inn seeking Ch\u00e9rubin, determined to discover whom he was serenading last night. He confesses to them that it was really L'Ensoleillad he was serenading.

The geese explain that the old trees will have to leave when a Man arrives: Paul Bunyan will be born at the next blue moon. To the horror of the old trees, the moon turns blue (\"It isn't very often the conservatives are wrong\").\nFirst ballad interlude\nThe Narrator recounts the birth and growth of Paul, who gained 346 pounds every week, became as tall as the Empire State Building and had a stride of 3.7 miles (\"The cold wind blew through the crooked thorn\"). One night, he awoke to find that his forehead was being licked by Babe the Blue Cow. The two of them leave for the South, where Paul sets up a camp.\n Act 1\nScene 1: A clearing in the forest\nPaul recruits lumberjacks from all over Europe (\"My birthplace was in Sweden, it's a very long way off\"). The Swedes quarrel over which of them should be foreman, but a Western Union Boy bicycles in with a telegram from the King of Sweden, whose recommended foreman, Hel Helson, arrives and is duly appointed by Paul. However, there is still a need for some cooks who can provide the lumberjacks with nutritious food. Bad cooks Sam and Ben, devotees (respectively) of soup and beans, arrive (\"Sam for Soups, Ben for beans\"). Johnny Inkslinger, an impecunious book-keeper, also turns up, but wishes to be independent and refuses offers of soup, beans and recompense before travelling on. Paul predicts that, as Inkslinger has no resources, he will have to return. Sam and Ben recruit cats Moppet and Poppet, and the dog Fido, to aid them in their work (\"The single creature lives a partial life\").\nIt is bedtime. Paul introduces a \"dream of warning\", sung by a quartet of the defeated (\"Gold in the North came the blizzard to say\"). Inkslinger, equally defeated, returns and accepts the job of book-keeper.\nSecond ballad interlude\nThe Narrator describes how Paul went wife-hunting, found an appropriately-sized partner (Carrie), and married her (\"The Spring came and the Summer and Fall\"). A daughter, Tiny, was born, but her parents' marriage was unhappy, and she and Carrie left home. Some years later, Carrie died, and Paul, before her funeral, promised Tiny that he would be a better father.\nScene 2: The camp\nWhile Paul is away, there is discontent at the unvarying rations of soup and beans (\"Do I look the sort of fellow Whom you might expect to bellow\"). Inkslinger tries to persuade Sam and Ben to vary the menu, but they walk away in a huff. The lumberjacks turn on Inkslinger, but are interrupted by the offstage voice of Slim (\"In fair days and in foul Round the world and back\"). He arrives and describes his attempts to \"find himself\" by continuous travelling (\"I come from open spaces\"). It turns out that he can cook flapjacks, cookies, fish, steak, and the loggers are appeased.\nPaul returns with Tiny. Inkslinger, dispirited, tells Fido the story of his life, which he feels he has wasted (\"It was out in the sticks that the fire Of my existence began\"). The lumberjacks mob Tiny, who is still mourning her mother's death (\"Whether the sun shine upon children playing\"), but she only has eyes for Slim. Paul wants to know if there were any problems while he was away. Inkslinger tells him that Hel Helson broods too much and keeps bad company, and that some of the men, particularly one called John Shears, are tired of logging and want to take up farming. They part on good terms, and Paul muses on the subject of the Actual and the Possible as the curtain falls.\n Act 2\nScene 1: A clearing\nPaul summons the lumberjacks and asks those who would like to be farmers to accompany him to the land of Heart's Desire, where everything is fertile. Shears and the others rejoice (\"It has always been my dream\"). Paul leaves Hel Helson in charge, telling him that the Topsy-Turvey Mountain needs to be cleared.\nHel's four cronies try to persuade him to mount a rebellion against Paul and Inkslinger. He sends them away, but the voices of a Heron, the Moon, the Wind, a Beetle and a Squirrel tell him that he is a failure (\"Heron, heron, winging by\"). Fido attempts to console him (\"Won't you tell me what's the matter?\"), but Hel kicks him out. Moppet and Poppet rejoice that they are not sentimental, like dogs (\"Let Man the romantic in vision espy\").\nWhen Paul returns, so do Hel's cronies, who persuade him to pick a fight with Paul. Tiny and Slim, oblivious of the sounds of the offstage fight, celebrate their love (\"Move, move, from the trysting stone\"). Hel, unconscious, is carried in (\"Take away the body and lay it on the ice\") . When he wakes up, he makes peace with Paul and rejects the cronies. The chorus hails a \"great day of discovery\" as Tiny and Slim continue their duet.\nThird ballad interlude\nThe Narrator recounts the continuing success of the logging industry and of Slim and Tiny's love (\"So Helson smiled and Bunyan smiled\"). Eventually, Babe indicates to Paul that it is time to move on, and he realises that she is right. It is Christmas Eve.\nScene 2: The Christmas party\nAmid the seasonal festivities, Inkslinger makes a number of announcements (\"Dear friends with your leave this Christmas Eve\"). Slim and Tiny will marry and move to Midtown Manhattan (\"Carry her over the water\"). Hel Helson will be joining the Administration in Washington to lead the Federal Plan of public works. John Shears has taken time off from his farm to join the party. As everyone cheers, the Western Union Boy reappears with a telegram from Hollywood. It is an invitation to Inkslinger to become a technical advisor for an all-star lumber picture! Finally, Paul takes his leave (\"Now the task that made us friends In a common labour, ends\"), and a Litany (\"The campfire embers are black and cold\") is sung. Inkslinger asks \"Paul, who are you?\", and Paul replies: \"Where the night becomes the day, Where the dream becomes the fact, I am the Eternal guest, I am Way, I am Act\"."},{"opera_title":"Francesca di Foix","composer":"Gaetano Donizetti","synopsis":"Time: The Middle AgesPlace: France\nThe Count is determined to keep his beautiful wife Francesca well away from the temptations of the French court.

The instigators of the hunt for Palm are Napoleon's occupying forces, who, along with a number of German princes, have been severely criticised in Palm's book. Philosophers, poets and students appeal to the inhabitants of the German territories to rise up against their exploitation and to unite their divided country. The students cannot agree on how to pursue their struggle: with the sword or the pen. Their leader Carlo Worms, an idealist, invokes the words of the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte and is in favour of demanding human rights and freedom of speech and thought in the spirit of Friedrich Schiller. Pitted against him in the debate are the members of a more radical group including Federico Loewe, a friend of Carlo Worms and an adversary in more ways than one, for they are in love with the same woman, Ricke, already betrothed to Loewe. Worms seduces Ricke while Loewe is away. Ricke is desperate because Worms warns her that Loewe and he will have to settle the matter in a duel if she confesses the act to Loewe.

Fosca, who loves Paolo, suggests double-crossing Giotta and claiming the money without releasing Paolo. The pirates reject this dishonourable plan. Gajolo asks Cambro to watch Fosca, and the pirates depart. Paolo, thinking he is to be executed, is brought out of his cell by Fosca. She confesses her love for him, but he rejects her: he is in love with Delia, to whom he is betrothed. Gajolo reappears with Giotta, who has paid Paolo's ransom, and, to Fosca's horror, father and son leave for Venice. Cambro asks Fosca what his reward might be if he can deliver Delia to her.

Rome clings to its old-fashioned polyphony as closely as it defends its religion. (2) Ighino and Silla discuss their singing: Silla thinks a singer should stand alone, but Ighino thinks that real strength lies subordinating the individual self to the larger complex idea. He is sad because his father has lost heart: fame made others jealous, his marriage led the Pope to dismiss him, and his wife died knowing this. Since then Palestrina has written nothing. Silla sings to him his new song. (3) Cardinal Borromeo is visiting Palestrina to explain that, because of growing secularism, the Pope plans to banish polyphony from the Mass and other offices, to burn the polyphonic masterpieces, and to revert entirely to the Gregorian chant. Emperor Ferdinand I hopes that a new polyphonic Mass can be written which will appease his fears. Borromeo wants Palestrina to undertake this, but, lacking the spirit, he refuses, and Borromeo leaves in anger. (4) Palestrina ponders his loss of faith and the weakness of love. In his despair, spirits of the great music-masters of previous ages appear and surround him. (5) The spirits tell Palestrina he belongs to their elect and must fulfil the task. He protests that in the modern consciousness (\"Bewusstseins\"), art cannot thrive. The spirits reply that this is his earthly mission: he must bring the light to his generation. They vanish. (6) In the darkness of his room angels begin to appear, singing the Mass, and his dead wife's spirit approaches. Not seeing them, Palestrina feels a surge of joy as the walls and ceiling open up to celestial light full of glory and angels, who sing the Gloria. In a creative transport Palestrina's pen is inspired, and as it all fades, he sinks exhausted to sleep, surrounded by sheets of music strewn all around. (7) Silla and Ighino enter while he sleeps, and find the music: it is a complete Mass, written in one night. Ighino rejoices, but Silla is sceptical.\n\tAct Two\n\tThe Great Hall in Cardinal Madruscht's Palace in Trent(Scene 1) Bishop Severolus and the Papal legate Novagerio prepare the hall for the final General Congress of the Council of Trent. The Cardinal of Lorraine (who has reached compromise with the Pope) and Count Luna, representative of the King of Spain (favouring Protestantism) must be seated equally and without precedence. (2) Cardinal Madruscht and Novagerio discuss the coming decision while awaiting the delegates, and they greet Borromeo. (3) While delegates arrive, Borromeo and Novagerio talk politics: Emperor Ferdinand and his son Maximilian plan to have dominion of the Catholic world (including Germany) from the throne of Spain, in union with the Kingship of Rome, which is offered to Maximilian even though he is secretly inclined to Lutheranism. But the Pope will preserve dogma by the interpretation of imperial decrees. Borromeo explains that Palestrina has refused the commission for the new polyphonic Mass. Novagerio insists that Palestrina must be forced into subordination, or be crushed. (4) Cardinal Madruscht deplores Lorraine's compromise with Rome, and urges the Cardinal of Prague to stand fast for doctrinal Reforms. The Spanish arrive and look scornfully at the Italians and the Bishop of Budoja. Morone, the other papal legate, arrives and the Council begins. (5) Morone opens the meeting hoping for unity of purpose between Emperor, Pope and Princes. The question of the polyphonic Mass is raised, but Borromeo tells them it is unfinished. The issue of the vernacular Mass and breviary arises, but then Count Luna and Cardinal of Lorraine dispute precedence, and Budoja disrupts proceedings to deflect Count Luna's case. Chaos breaks out: the meeting is adjourned till the afternoon, when everything must be resolved. The delegates disperse. (6) Lorraine protests to Morone that he should have precedence, but Morone is angry that he has provoked Count Luna. Novagerio appeals to Lorraine to consider the interests of the Pope. Badoja makes himself objectionable. (7) The Spanish servants, and a group of German and Italian servants, shout abuse at each other and a battle with daggers ensues. Cardinal Madruscht appears with a troop of soldiers, and commands them to shoot to kill. A volley is fired, and many fall dead and wounded: all the survivors are seized and carried off for torture.\n\tAct Three\n\tPalestrina's house in Rome, as in the First Act.(Scene 1) Palestrina, aged and very tired, waits in his room with Ighino and some choristers. Borromeo imprisoned him for refusing the commission, but Ighino handed the music of the Mass over to save his father from the hangman. Now it is being sung before the Pope. Ighino begs his father to reawaken to life and to embrace the son who loves him. Suddenly the voices of singers from the Papal chapel are heard from the street singing 'Evviva Palestrina, the Saviour of Music!' (2) Papal singers come into the room, saying how greatly the Mass has pleased everyone. Pope Pius IV himself enters with eight Cardinals (including Borromeo), Palestrina kneels, and the Pope asks him to return and lead the Sistine Choir until the end of his days. Then they leave, but Borromeo remains and prostrates himself in tears, begging Palestrina's forgiveness. Palestrina raises him up, kisses him on the cheek and embraces him, for both are shattered vessels that must be filled with the breath of love. Borromeo, much chastened, departs: Ighino embraces his father, and asks if he will now be happy. Silla has gone to Florence, but Ighino will remain: in joy the boy rushes out into the street. Palestrina looks at his wife's portrait, and with an expression of devotion to God sits at the organ and begins to play."},{"opera_title":"Enrico di Borgogna","composer":"Gaetano Donizetti","synopsis":"Time: The Middle AgesPlace: Burgundy"},{"opera_title":"Der Frau ohne Schatten","composer":"Richard Strauss","synopsis":"The Woman Without a Shadow\nACT I\n\tThe emperor of the Eastern Islands once nearly killed the daughter of Keikobad, lord of the spirits, while out hunting.

As she finishes the letter, Bumerli himself appears through the window. Nadina gives him his letter, but he does not take it seriously. If she did not love him she would not be so jealous.\nMassakroff appears, with a challenge to a duel from Alexius to Bumerli. Bumerli accepts without hesitation, much to Nadina's consternation. Alexius is also terrified - he would never have challenged his rival if he had not been sure he was too much of a coward to accept. It seems Alexius is coming round to the idea he would be happier with Mascha anyway.\nAny doubts among the family that Bumerli would not make a good husband for Nadina are dispelled by the revelation that he is the son of a wealthy Swiss businessman, and all ends happily."},{"opera_title":"Riccardo e Zoraide","composer":"Giaochino Rossini","synopsis":"Place: the city of Dongola in ancient Nubia.Time: The time of the Crusades\nThe Nubian King Agorante, who is infatuated with Zoraide, has defeated her father, Ircano and captured her.

Filippo has grown tired of his wife Beatrice; she regrets her impetuous marriage to him after her first husband's death, a marriage that has delivered her and her people into the Duke's tyrannical power.\n Act 1\nFilippo attends a ball at the Castle Binasco in Italy, shadowed as usual by the sinister Rizzardo. He is fed up with everyone paying obeisance to his wife. His sycophantic courtiers tell him how much they sympathize, and suggest that Beatrice's servants are all plotting against him.\nBeautiful harp music is heard. Agnese, the current object of Filippo's lust, sings from afar that life is empty without love. Filippo echoes her thoughts and states how much he loves her; she has no equal. His courtiers again sympathize with him and encourage him to seize the moment. Agnese disappears and all leave. Then Agnese reappears, this time singing for Orombello. Mysteriously, she wishes that her heart will guide him to her arms and, as in all good opera plots, the object of her lust makes his entrance. Orombello splutters that he does not know where he is or why he is there. Comforted by Agnese, he begins to relax and agrees that he is deeply in love and, when asked about a letter, shows her the one he is carrying. \"Such misfortune!\" The letter he is referring to is one of many he has written to Beatrice and not the one that Agnese had sent to him. Agnese's world falls apart, her tenderness turns to vitriol, and the two of them spit out a dramatic aria and leave.\nBeatrice enters one of her secret places with her ladies. She is happy, but soon loses her poise and laments how misguided she has been to have married the evil Duke Filippo. As they all go to leave, Filippo sees them in the distance and, believing she is avoiding him, demands that she be brought back. The two of them accuse and rage at each other, with Filippo producing some secret papers stolen from Beatrice's apartment.\nIn another scene, slightly the worse for wear, Filippo's soldiers discuss his silence and temper. Beatrice enters carrying a portrait of her beloved, deceased husband, Facino. She is bemoaning the fact that everyone has abandoned her when Orombello enters protesting that he has not. Excitedly, he tells her his plans to rally the troops and help her free herself. She crushes him saying, in so many words, that she does not rate his expertise in security matters. Stunned, Orombello protests his love and, even when begged to do so, will not leave her presence; instead, he kneels down in front of her, at which moment Agnese and Filippo enter and accuse the two traitors of having an affair. Everyone now joins in with accusation, counter accusation, attack and defence. The upshot is that Filippo has the pair arrested - to be tried in Court for adultery.\n Act 2\nThe courtiers learn of the terrible torture that has been applied to Orombello. Then, the Court is summoned and Filippo sets out the case for the prosecution. Beatrice is dragged in, and she protests that the Court has no jurisdiction. Next, Orombello is hauled in and, after desperately seeking forgiveness from Beatrice, proclaims her innocence. Beatrice regains her will to live and something in her speaking touches Filippo's heart. He announces that the sentence should be delayed. The Court overrules him stating that more torture should be applied until the truth is spoken. Again, Filippo changes his mind and, supporting the Court's decision, instructs that, indeed, more torture seems to be necessary to extract the truth. The Court rises.\nFilippo and Agnese, full of remorse, are left alone and Agnese, realizing that things have gone much further than she had expected, begs Filippo to drop all the charges; but Filippo, not wishing to look weak, dismisses the idea.\nFilippo now goes through several stages of torment and is obviously still deeply in love with Beatrice. Just as he has made up his mind to drop all the charges, with cruel timing, men still loyal to the late condottiere Facino arrive, to invade the castle. As a result, Filippo signs the death warrant now handed to him by Anichino* and tries to justify his actions to the crowd, blaming Beatrice's behaviour.\nThere is a scene in which we see Beatrice's ladies outside Orombello's cell, while Beatrice prays. The action reaches its finale."},{"opera_title":"Hans Heiling","composer":"Heinrich Marschner","synopsis":"Place: Bohemian ore mountainsTime: 14th century.\n\tPrologue\n\tAfter falling in love with the mortal Anna, Hans Heiling plans to leave the underworld empire of Erdgeister to wed her.

Aliprando draws their attention to two inscriptions on the castle gates (Chi vi guida a questa mura? - \"Who brings you to these walls?\"), but since the peasants have not been taught to read, he is obliged to read them out: \"Anyone entering without permission will have their heads split in two\" and \"Anyone who disturbs the peace will be starved to death\". He and Ginardo confirm that the ferocious Corradino will have no hesitation in carrying out these threats, and furthermore he has a particular hatred of women (Se viene il Cerbero fioccano i guai - \"When Cerberus comes, woes rain down\"). The alarmed peasants disperse rapidly. Ginardo asks Udolfo to check that Corradino's prisoners are not being ill-treated, except that he himself will visit the most recent arrival, Edoardo, the son of Corradino's enemy Raimondo Lopez.\nThe wandering poet Isidoro arrives with his guitar at the castle, tired, hungry and thirsty, having travelled all the way from Naples. Seeing the castle, he hopes that his luck will change (Cavatina: Intanto Armenia 'nfra l'ombrose piante - \"Meanwhile, Armenia, through the shady trees\"), but, when he sees the inscriptions, his instinct is to flee. But he accidentally runs into Ginardo, who tells him that it is too late. Corradino, armed and surrounded by guards, makes his appearance and demands to know who Isidoro is and why he is there (Quartet: Alma rea! Perch\u00e9 t'involi? - \"Wicked man! Why are you running away?\"). Isidoro tries to curry favour with Corradino by offering to serenade his ladies, but this enrages the tyrant further. He is about to kill the poet when Aliprando intervenes. Corradino relents, but Isidoro is marched off to the dungeons by Ginardo.\nAliprando tells Corradino that Matilde, whose father, Shabran, has been killed in battle, is approaching the castle. With his dying breath, Shabran commended her to Corradino's care. Corradino, who respected Shabran, agrees to accommodate Matilde in fine apartments, but wishes her to be kept out of his sight unless he summons her. Aliprando goes to meet her.\nGinardo returns, telling Corradino that Edoardo is weeping and may be repentant. But when he brings the chained prisoner to Corradino, it is clear that Edoardo remains defiant. Corradino demands that he acknowledge him as the victor over his father. Edoardo refuses (Cavatina: Piange il mio ciglio, \u00e8 vero - \"It's true that tears fall from my eyes\"), but Corradino has his chains removed and will give him the run of the castle if he promises not to escape. Edoardo agrees and goes in. Ginardo reports that Aliprando and Matilde are approaching the castle. Corradino vows to find Matilde a husband and supply her with a dowry, but will see her as little as possible. Ginardo, alone, muses that a heart of iron (\"cuor di ferro\") may not be enough to save his master from Cupid's darts.\nScene 2: A magnificent gallery in the castle\nMatilde tells Aliprando that Corradino will yield to her (Duet: Di capricci, di smorfiette - \"I've caprices, little glances\"). The physician is not so sure, but he admires her spirit and tells her that Corradino, despite his warlike demeanour, runs to him whenever he has a headache or a cold. Maybe his dislike of women can be overcome.\nGinardo announces the arrival of the Contessa d'Arco, who, as a result of a peace treaty, was promised in marriage to Corradino. He had immediately repudiated her, but was obliged to agree that he would not marry anyone else. The Countess has heard that Matilde is to be accommodated in the castle and intends to have her evicted. The women insult each other, and the resulting noise brings Corradino and his guards to the gallery (Quintet: Questa \u00e8 la Dea? Che aria! - \"This is the goddess? What a picture!\"). Matilde stands firm, Ginardo and Aliprando are amazed that Corradino makes no attempt to kill her for her impertinence, and the Countess is further enraged. Corradino is confused - his head is spinning and his blood is burning. He asks Ginardo to look after Matilde, and departs with Aliprando. The Countess storms off, pursued by Matilde.\nCorradino asks Aliprando what is wrong with him, and is told that he is lovesick, which is a disease with no cure. Aliprando leaves, and Corradino summons Isidoro, whom he suspects of bewitching him, from his prison. Isidoro, in fear of his life, has no idea what he is talking about, but, just when Corradino is about to have him torn into pieces, a contrite Matilde appears. Ginardo is to take Isidoro back to the dungeon, but the two of them hide in order to watch developments. The bemused Corradino succumbs to Matilde's wiles (Finale: Ah! Capisco; non parlate - \"Ah! I understand, do not speak\"), and falls at her feet just as Aliprando arrives to announce that Raimondo and his troops are on their way to rescue Edoardo. Corradino leaves to give orders to the guards, taking Matilde with him, as the others comment on his surrender to her.\nScene 3: Outside the castle gatehouse\nEdoardo, Rodrigo and the guards await the enemy. Corradino, Matilde, Aliprando and Ginardo come through the gate, together with Isidoro and his guitar (he has appointed himself court poet). The Countess follows them. When Corradino tells Edoardo that his father will be defeated, Edoardo is overcome, but when Matilde comforts the boy, Corradino succumbs to jealousy. An ensemble (Oh come mai quest'anima svavilla in un momento! - \"Oh, how my soul flares up in a minute!\") develops, Isidoro urges the guards onwards, and the curtain falls.\n Act 2\nScene 1: The countryside near the castle\nIsidoro, sitting in a tree, is writing about his exploits. The peasants and Corradino's troops arrive (Di Corradino il nome per ogni suol rimbomba - \"May the name of Corradino resound in every country\"), and, although they know that most of what Isidoro has written is made up, he persuades them that that's what poets do (Le penne de i poeti so spade assai diverse - \"Poets' pens are quite different weapons\"), and they nevertheless salute him and take him with them.\nRaimondo appears, laments the loss of his son, and departs. Edoardo, dispirited, longs for death (Cavatina: Ah! perch\u00e9, perch\u00e9 la morte non ascolta i pianti miei - \"Ah, why, why does death ignore my tears\") but then he hears Raimondo calling his name. Corradino and Raimondo arrive simultaneously, but, before they can fight, Edoardo takes Raimondo's place. As he fights Corradino, he tells him that it was Matilde who set him free. Corradino rushes off in a rage, and father and son leave together.\nScene 2: The gallery in the castle\nThe Countess reveals that Edoardo had bribed the guards and escaped. She is sure that Corradino will blame Matilde, who now arrives, followed by Isidoro. He tells the ladies how he saved the day by taking command of the army. Ginardo and Aliprando confirm that the enemy has been routed, but add that Corradino ran off to find Raimondo and challenge him to a duel. Corradino returns, demanding to see Edoardo, but Ginardo discovers that he has escaped. Corradino starts to question Matilde, but Rodrigo enters with a letter for her. It is from Edoardo, who swears undying love for her and thanks her for allowing him to escape. Corradino condemns her to death, to the delight of the Countess (Sextet: E palese il tradimento - \"Her treachery is obvious\"). Isidoro and the guards are to take Matilde to a deep chasm and throw her in. Corradino, alone, meditates on his revenge. He is joined by some peasant women, but their pleas that Matilde be saved (Mandare a morte quella meschina? - \"Are you really sending that poor girl to her death?\") fall on deaf ears. As they leave, Isidoro, Ginardo, Aliprando and the Countess return. Isidoro describes how he kicked Matilde into the gorge, amid conflicting emotions from the others.\nSuddenly, Edoardo appears and describes how the Countess bribed Udolfo to release him, with the intention of throwing the blame on Matilde. The Countess flees Corradino's wrath, and he and Edoardo lament Matilde's death (Duet: Da cento smanie, e cento sento straziarmi il cor - \"A hundred agonies, and then a hundred more, pierce my heart\").\nScene 3: Outside Raimondo's castle: a steep mountain with a raging torrent plunging into a gorge\nIsidoro is at the foot of the mountain and Corradino is above, planning to throw himself off in order to atone for Matilde's death. But before he can do so, a bell rings and Raimondo emerges from the castle. Aliprando and Ginardo try to restrain Corradino as Edoardo rushes into the castle, immediately returning with Matilde. Isidoro admits that he made up the story of Matilde's death, Matilde thanks Edoardo, instructs Corradino to make peace with Raimondo and regrets that the Countess is not there to see her triumph. She and Corradino are reunited, and, to general rejoicing, she sings in praise of love (Ami alfine? E chi non ama? - \"Are you at last in love? Who does not love?\") as the peasants comment: \"Women are born to conquer and rule\"."},{"opera_title":"Pell\u00e9as et Melisande","composer":"Claude Debussy","synopsis":"ACT I\nSCENE 1: A forest\nGolaud, lost in the forest while hunting, finds a young girl weeping by the side of a pool.

Carmela then goes into the house.\nMaliella runs in, with the Camorrists after her. Rafaele is in pursuit, he being the leader of the band, a handsome, flashy blackguard. When he advances to seize and kiss her, she draws out a hat pin. Laughing, he throws off his coat, like a duellist, grasps and holds her tightly. She stabs his hand, making it bleed, then throws away the pin. He laughs disdainfully, passionately kisses the wound. There is an extended scene with accepting and rejecting flowers, wearing them, tossing them away. Rafaele heads for the inn - she turns to look at him.\nAs the Madonna is brought past in procession during tolling of bellsa and cheers from the people, Rafaele pours words of passion into Maliella's ears. The image of the Virgin, bedecked with sparkling jewels--the jewels of the Madonna--is carried past. Rafaele swears that for the love of Maliella he would even rob the sacred image of the jewels and bedeck her with them--something so sacrilegious that it would never be considered. The superstitious girl is terrified.\nGennaro, who returns at that moment, warns her against Rafaele--and the men seem about to fight. But then the procession returns, and they all kneel. Rafaele and Maliella exchange looks, as she heads back to the house. He tosses her the flower she has previously despised. She picks it up, puts it between her lips, and flies indoors.\n Act 2\nCarmela's Garden\nOn the left wall a wooden staircase. Under this is a gap in the back wall shut in by a railing. It is late evening. Carmela, having cleared the table, goes into the house. Gennaro starts in to warn Maliella. She says she will have freedom, rushes up the staircase to her room, where she is seen putting her things together, while she hums, \"E ndringhete, ndranghete\" (I long for mirth and folly).\nShe descends with her bundle and is ready to leave. Gennaro pleads with her. As if lost in a reverie, with eyes half-closed, she recalls how Rafaele offered to steal the jewels of the Madonna for her. Gennaro, at first shocked at the sacrilege in the mere suggestion, appears to yield gradually to a desperate intention. He bars the way to Maliella, locks the gate, and stands facing her. Laughing derisively, she ascends the stairs again.\nHe goes to a cupboard under the stairs, takes out a box, opens it by the light of the lamp at the table, selects several skeleton keys and files, wraps them in a piece of leather, which he hides under his coat, takes a look at Maliella's window, crosses himself, and sneaks out.\nFrom the direction of the sea a chorus of men's voices is heard. Rafaele appears at the gate with his Camorrist friends. To the accompaniment of their mandolins and guitars he sings a serenade to Maliella. The girl comes down into the garden. Then they sing a love duet, she promising that she will join him tomorrow. Then Rafaele's comrades signal that someone is coming.\nLeft to herself, she sees Gennaro's open tool box, by moonlight. As if in answer to her presentiment of what it signifies, he appears with a bundle wrapped in red cloth. He throws back the folds of the damask and spreads out on the table, for Maliella, the jewels of the Madonna.\nIn an ecstacy, Maliella evisions in Gennaro the man who promised her these jewels--Rafaele, and yields herself to Gennaro's embrace.\n Act 3\nA hidden refuge of the Camorrists on the outskirts of Naples\nOn the left wall is a rough fresco of the Madonna, whose image was borne in procession the previous day. In front of it is a sort of altar.\nThe Camorrists gather. They are men and women, all the latter of doubtful character. There is singing with dancing-the \"Apache,\" the \"Tarantelle.\" Stella, Concetta, Serena, and Grazia, the dancer, are the principal women. They do not anticipate Maliella's expected arrival with much pleasure. When Rafaele comes in, they ask him what he admires in her. In his answer, \"Non sapete... di Maliella\" (know you not of Maliella), he tells them her chief charm is that he will be the first man to whom she has yielded herself.\nIn the midst of an uproar of shouting and dancing, while Rafaele, standing on a table, cracks a whip, Maliella rushes in. In an agony she cries out that, in a trance, she gave herself up to Gennaro. The women laugh derisively at Rafaele, who has just sung of her as being inviolable to all but himself. There is not a touch of mysticism about Rafaele. That she should have confused Gennaro. with him, and so have yielded herself to the young blacksmith, does not appeal to him at all. For him she is a plucked rose to be left to wither. Furiously he rejects her, flings her to the ground. The jewels of the Madonna fall from her cloak. They are readily recognized; for they are depicted in the rough fresco on the wall.\nGennaro, who has followed her to the haunt of the Camorrists, enters. He is half mad. Maliella, laughing hysterically, flings the jewels at his feet, shrieking that he stole them for her. The crowd, as superstitious as it is criminal, recoils from both intruders. The women fall to their knees. Rafaele curses the girl. At his command, the band disperses. Maliella goes out to drown herself in the sea. \"Madonna dei dolor! Miserere!\" (Madonna of our pain, have pity), prays Gennaro. His thoughts revert to his mother. \"Deh no piangere, O Mamma mia\" (Ah! Weep not, beloved mother mine) . Among the d\u00e9bris he finds a knife and plunges it into his heart."},{"opera_title":"Aureliano in Palmira","composer":"Giaochino Rossini","synopsis":"Palmyra has now been conquered by the Romans.

She begins an affair with a young man, Jean Gaussin, but the relationship, as is so often the case in opera, is ill-fated.\n Act 1\nA fancy ball at Caoudal's studio\nJean Gaussin is a shy and unsophisticated young man from Provence, who has come to Paris to study. At a costume ball given by the sculptor Caoudal, amid the noisy dance music and the mad whirl, the confused Gaussin withdraws and sings of his native country, in a broad and expressive cantabile, one of the few aria-like passages that the opera contains. Fanny, whose fancy is captured by this young man, so strangely different from her friends, promptly makes his acquaintance, and, as the guests are shouting for her to come to supper, takes him away with her.\n Act 2\nRooms of Jean Gaussin\nJean Gaussin is in his lodgings, where his parents are installing him as a student. He sings a song, \"O Magali, ma tant amado\", based on a traditional melody, which Gounod had already used in Mireille. It reappears later and adds a bit of Proven\u00e7al local colour to the piece. Other than this song and a fragment of his aria from the first act, all is conversation in music, rapid and free declamation over a continually varied orchestral accompaniment.\nGaussin's father and mother and Ir\u00e8ne, a \"jeune fille,\" adopted by them, and evidently destined as the wife for Jean, say \"good-bye\". No sooner are they out the door than Fanny comes in, unannounced, immediately takes possession of Jean and the apartment, and drives out all memory of his parents. Here is more of the conversational style, interrupted by a duet between these two that has the accent of passion.\n Act 3\nScene 1: The restaurant at Ville-d'Avray\nThe lovers are at a little outdoor restaurant near Paris, and still very happy, as they sing together in another duet. There is an artists' dinner at the place, and as the diners arrive there is more lively chorusing and an imitation of a wandering band. By a chance word from Caoudal, Jean learns for the first time that his adored Fanny is none other than Sapho, the notorious model, and he is told something of her past. He is thunderstruck, and when Fanny reappears to join the party, she at once sees what has happened, as Jean turns upon her with rage and leaves. She sings her own rage in music much more declamatory than lyrical, and the scene is suddenly and violently brought to an end.\nScene 2: Fanny and Jean's house at Ville-d'Avray\nJean has returned to their house and finds a box belonging to Fanny containing letters from her past lovers. Fanny has followed him. He forces her to burn the letters after reading them first, learning that she has an illegitimate child whose father is a convicted forger. Finding it increasingly difficult to believe that he is her first and only true love, he brutally rejects her and leaves.\n Act 4\nAt Avignon\nJean has gone back to his parents in Provence. The \"Magali\" air is heard in the prelude, sung at a distance. Jean has come back to ask forgiveness, which he very promptly obtains from his mother, in a duet. This is followed by an affectionate air sung by Ir\u00e8ne. Unexpectedly Sapho appears, with the obvious intention of reclaiming Jean. He receives her coldly and reminds her of her past and the impossibility of his rejoining her. Fanny is defeated in an encounter with his mother and goes away without him.\n Act 5\nThe little house at Ville-d'Avray\nThe long prelude to this act is titled \"Solitude\". Fanny is alone in the country lodging they previously shared and is about to leave, when Jean returns. She asks him to go again, but he will not have it, and says he is now ready to sacrifice all that life may hold for him. She promises to stay, but as he falls asleep in his chair, though convinced of his sincerity, she steals away and leaves him."},{"opera_title":"Djamileh","composer":"Georges Bizet","synopsis":"Place: The palace of Haroun, in Cairo\nAt the end of day Haroun reclines and smokes in his palace, with his servant Splendiano; an off-stage chorus sing.

As she and her nurse arrive at Barbe-bleue's castle, they are greeted (offstage) by a chorus of peasants clamouring for Barbe-bleue's death because they believe he has murdered his former wives. Ariane is convinced they are still alive. She declares: Il m'aime, je suis belle, et j'aurai son secret. D'abord il faut d\u00e9sob\u00e9ir: c'est le premier devoir quand l'ordre est mena\u00e7ant et ne s'explique pas. - Les autres ont eu tort et les voil\u00e0\u00a0 perdues pour avoir h\u00e9sit\u00e9. (\"He loves me, I am beautiful, and I will discover his secret. First one must disobey: it's the primal duty when an order is menacing and unexplained. - The others were mistaken and now they are lost because they hesitated.\")\n\tBarbe-bleue has given her seven keys to his treasure chambers: the six silver ones she is permitted to use, but the seventh, golden key is forbidden. Ariane says this is the only key which matters and goes to look for the seventh door while her nurse opens the others. The nurse turns the lock in the first door and a cascade of jewels and other treasures spills out. The second door reveals a \"shower of sapphires\"; the third, a \"deluge of pearls\"; the fourth, a \"waterfall of emeralds\"; the fifth, \"a tragic torrent of rubies\"; and the sixth, \"avalanches of gigantic diamonds.\" The sixth door also reveals the vault containing the seventh to Ariane. Ignoring her nurse's warning, she turns the golden key in the lock. At first it reveals nothing but darkness, then \"the stifled sounds of far away singing rise from the bowels of the earth and spread across the hall.\" It is the voices of Barbe-bleue's other wives singing a folk song \"Les cinq filles d'Orlamonde\" (\"The five maids of Orlamonde\"). The nurse is terrified and tries to shut the door again but she is powerless to move it as the voices draw nearer. At the last words of the song, Barbe-bleue enters the hall. He accuses Ariane: Vous aussi... (\"You too...\"). She replies, Moi surtout (\"Me above all\"). He tells her that through her disobedience she is abandoning the happiness he has offered her. She tells him, \"The happiness I want cannot thrive in the shadows.\" Barbe-bleue grabs her by the arm and tries to drag her towards the seventh door. As he does so, the furious peasants smash the windows and break into the hall to confront Barbe-bleue, who draws his sword in defence. But Ariane calmly turns to the crowd and asks them \"What do you want? - He has done me no harm\" before closing the door on them.\n\tAct 2\n\tScene: A vast, underground hall, at first shrouded in almost complete darkness\n\tThe seventh door has shut behind Ariane and the nurse. They explore the darkness with the aid of a lamp. Ariane is not afraid and believes Barbe-bleue will free them of his own accord: Il est bless\u00e9, il est vaincu, mais il l'ignore encore... (\"He is wounded, he is defeated, but he doesn't know it yet...\"). She finds the other wives hiding in the darkness, dressed in rags and terrified, but alive. She embraces them and says she has come to free them. She asks them if they have tried to escape. One wife (S\u00e9lysette) replies: On ne pourrait pas fuir; car tout est bien ferm\u00e9; est puis c'est d\u00e9fendu (\"We couldn't; everything is barred and bolted; besides, it is forbidden.\") She asks their names and they give them, except for Alladine who is a foreigner and unable to speak. Drops of water from the vault extinguish Ariane's lamp and they are plunged into darkness. But Ariane thinks she can make out a faint source of light and gropes towards it. She finds it is a stained-glass window covered in grime. Taking a stone, she smashes the panes one by one and is dazzled by the light flooding in. The wives follow her. They can hear the sound of the sea, wind in the trees and the singing of birds. They gaze on a green country landscape as a village clock strikes midday. Ariane tells them not to be afraid but to follow the stone steps which lead down into the outside world.\n\tAct 3\n\tScene: The same as Act 1\n\tThe castle's magic defences have prevented the wives from escaping and they find themselves in the hall, but they are happy as long as they are with Ariane. Barbe-bleue is nowhere to be seen. Ariane is certain they will soon be liberated. She helps the other wives to decorate themselves with the jewels from the six doors. The nurse enters and tells them Barbe-bleue is on his way. They look through the windows only to see Barbe-bleue's carriage ambushed by rebel peasants. Barbe-bleue's bodyguard is cut down and he is badly beaten. Ariane pleads with them not to kill him but they cannot hear. The peasants break down the castle door and enter with Barbe-bleue roped up. They fall silent at the sight of his wives and willingly turn over their captive to Ariane so she can take \"vengeance\". She thanks them and persuades them to leave the castle. The wives delicately care for the wounded Barbe-bleue before Ariane cuts his bonds with a dagger. Barbe-bleue is free and silently gazes at Ariane. She bids him \"Farewell\". He makes a feeble attempt to stop her then relents. Ariane asks the other wives if they are going to follow her: La for\u00eat et la mer nous appellent de loin et l'aurore se penche aux vo\u00fbtes de l'azur, pour nous montrer un monde inond\u00e9 d'esp\u00e9rance... (\"The forest and the sea are beckoning from afar and dawn is spreading over the azure heavens and will reveal a world filled with hope...\"). None of them accepts the offer and Ariane leaves alone with her nurse.

Creon, brother-in-law to Oedipus, returns from the oracle at Delphi and declaims the words of the gods: Thebes is harboring the murderer of Laius, the previous king. It is the murderer who has brought the plague upon the city. Oedipus promises to discover the murderer and cast him out. He questions Tiresias, the soothsayer, who at first refuses to speak. Angered at this silence, Oedipus accuses him of being the murderer himself. Provoked, Tiresias speaks at last, stating that the murderer of the king is a king.

An ancient shepherd arrives: it was he who had found the child Oedipus in the mountains. Jocasta, realizing the truth, flees. At last, the messenger and shepherd state the truth openly: Oedipus is the child of Laius and Jocasta, killer of his father, husband of his mother. Shattered, Oedipus leaves. The messenger reports the death of Jocasta: she has hanged herself in her chambers. Oedipus breaks into her room and puts out his eyes with her pin. He departs Thebes forever as the chorus at first vents their anger, and then mourns the loss of the king they loved."},{"opera_title":"Der Jakobiner","composer":"Antonin Dvorak","synopsis":"Place: a small country town in BohemiaTime: 1793\n Act 1\nBohu\u0161 has returned to his home-town, incognito, with his wife Julie. His mother is dead and his father, the Count, has disowned him and has become a recluse. Meanwhile, the Count's Burgrave pays court to the schoolmaster Benda's daughter, Terinka, who is, however, in love with Ji\u0159\u00ed. The Burgrave is suspicious of Bohu\u0161 and Julie, especially as they have come from Paris, where the Count's son is said to be allied with the Jacobins. To everyone's surprise, the Count himself now appears, confirming that he no longer regards Bohu\u0161 as his son, and that his heir will be his nephew Adolf. Adolf and the Burgrave rejoice, while Bohu\u0161 and Julie, hidden among the crowd, are horrified at the turn that events have taken.\n Act 2\nIn the school, Benda rehearses a chorus of children and townsfolk, together with Terinka and Ji\u0159\u00ed as soloists, in a cantata which will celebrate Adolf's new position. After the rehearsal, Terinka and Ji\u0159\u00ed declare their love, but Benda returns and announces that his daughter must marry the Burgrave. An argument develops, but suddenly the people return, alarmed at the rumour that sinister Jacobins have arrived in the town. The townsfolk run away in terror as Bohu\u0161 and Julie arrive to ask Benda if he can accommodate them for a few days. He is inclined to refuse, but when they reveal that they are Czechs who have sustained themselves in foreign countries through singing the songs of their native land, he, Terinka and Ji\u0159\u00ed are overcome with emotion and are happy to shelter them. The Burgrave comes to woo Terinka, but she rejects him. When Ji\u0159\u00ed defies him, the Burgrave threatens to force him into the army, but suddenly Adolf enters, wanting to find out if the \"Jacobin\" (Bohu\u0161) has been arrested. The Burgrave prevaricates, but Bohu\u0161 himself arrives and reveals who he is. He and Adolf quarrel, and Adolf orders Bohu\u0161's arrest.\n Act 3\nAt the castle, Ji\u0159\u00ed tries to see the Count to tell him that his son has been imprisoned, but is himself arrested at the behest of Adolf and the Burgrave. Lotinka admits Julie and Benda, and goes to fetch the Count. Julie hides, and Benda tries to prepare the old man for a reconciliation with Bohu\u0161. The Count, however, is still angry with his son for marrying and leaving Bohemia and for his alleged Jacobin sympathies. Benda departs, and the Count laments his lonely life and wonders whether he has, after all, misjudged his son. Offstage, Julie sings a song that the late Countess used to sing to Bohu\u0161 when he was a child, and the Count, recognising it and overcome with emotion, asks Julie where she learnt it. Once he discovers that it was his son who taught it to her, his anger returns, but Julie is able to convince him that Bohu\u0161, far from being a Jacobin, supported the Girondins and had been condemned to death by the Jacobins. She now reveals that Bohu\u0161 is in prison and that she is his wife, but the celebrations are about to start, and she leaves.\nThe children and townsfolk rejoice, and the Count announces that he will present his successor to them. Adolf is overjoyed, but the Count first enquires of him and the Burgrave whether there are any prisoners that he can pardon as part of the festivities. They reluctantly admit that there are, and Bohu\u0161 and Ji\u0159\u00ed are summoned. The Burgrave realises that the game is up as the Count denounces the scheming Adolf and embraces Bohu\u0161 and Julie. Bohu\u0161 praises the loyalty of Ji\u0159\u00ed and Terinka, and the Count joins their hands.

Fritz wants to marry Grete, but he tells her that before that happens, he has to write a great piece of music and discover the mysterious distant sound (\"der ferne Klang\") which he hears within him. Grete tries in vain to convince him to stay with her.

Graumann has just gambled his daughter away to his landlord in a dice game and they have come to collect the debt. When Grete refuses, her father becomes furious. Before he can do violence to his daughter, his comrades drag Graumann back to the pub.\n\tTo calm her mother down, Grete pretends to be happy to marry the landlord.

It is Fritz, who recognizes Grete immediately and goes straight to her. He tells her that he has not found the distant sound that has been eluding him these past ten years, so he has gone in search of her instead and now wants to make her his wife.\n\tWhile Grete is still in love with Fritz and would like to be with him, she decides she must reveal to him that she is a courtesan, and then asks if he still wants to marry her.

Mariya arrives, and they all plead with her to join them, but there is company at her house: The Hetman Mazeppa, and so she cannot stay with them. After they leave, she reveals that games have no temptation for her anymore, for she is in love with Mazeppa. Her childhood friend, Andrei, overhears her, and tries to comfort her, but when she thanks him for his kind friendship, he reveals he always loved her. She wishes it could be different, that she could love him too - but fate will not allow it. Andrei rushes off in despair. Mariya's father and mother, Vasily and Lyubov Kochubey arrive with the guests, and dance and song are provided for Mazeppa's entertainment, including the famous Hopak.\nThen Mazeppa draws Kochubey aside, and asks for his daughter's hand. Kochubey thinks he's joking at first - he is, after all, very old. Mazeppa claims that the passions of an old heart, once lit, are not like those of a young heart that burn brightly but then fade - they smoulder forever. Kochubey points out, however, that Mazeppa is Mariya's godfather, which is considered closer than a blood tie in the Russian Orthodox Church. Mazeppa replies that he can easily apply to the church for an exemption. Kochubey orders Mazeppa to leave. Mazeppa replies that he has already asked Mariya's hand, and been accepted, with a slight hint that he may already have had his way with Mariya. Kochubey still refuses, and Mazeppa calls in his guard. Mazeppa demands submission, everyone else curses his immoral desires and rise up against him, but just as battle is about to break out, Mariya throws herself between the two groups. As he leaves, Mazeppa calls for Mariya to decide whether she wishes to stay at home and never see him again, or to come with him. She chooses him to everyone's surprise and distress.\nScene 2: A room in Kochubey's manor\nLyubov mourns Mariya's loss, the women of the house trying to comfort her, to no avail. She sends them away and tries to stir Kochubey to rouse the Cossacks to war and go to attack Mazeppa - but he has a better plan: Whilst the two were still friends, Mazeppa hinted at a plan to ally with Sweden and fight to free Ukraine from Peter the Great's rule. Iskra, Kochubey's friend, is all for it, but they need a messenger. Andrei, who feels his life is over after having lost Mariya, agrees to deliver it. Everyone curses Mazeppa and relishes the thought of his execution.\n Act 2\nScene 1: A dungeon in Mazeppa's castle, night.\nThe plan has not gone well. Peter the Great sided with Mazeppa, and turned Kochubey over to him, sending, as Kochubey puts it, a loyal servant into the hand of a treasonous one. Under torture, Kochubey has made a false confession. Kochubey is trying to make himself right with God, and thinks he hears the priest coming to hear his last confession - but instead, it turns out to be Orlik, Mazeppa's henchman and torturer. Kochubey asks what more he could want - he had agreed under torture to everything that had been asked of him. But he hadn't revealed the location of his hidden treasures. He tells them to send Mariya, who will show them everything, and let him pray before his execution: he has already lost his treasures - His honour to a false confession extracted under torture, Mariya's honour to Mazeppa, and now has only the prospect of God's Vengeance after his death. This is not enough for Orlik - the tortures recommence.\nScene 2: A terrace of Mazeppa's castle. The same night\nMazeppa ponders the terrible blow that will befall Mariya when she learns what he has done to her father - He has to be strong whilst he's trying to consolidate his power, but Mariya... Orlik arrives. Kochubey has revealed nothing about his treasure as yet. The execution is set for dawn, and Orlik is sent off to resume what needs to be done. Mazeppa ponders Mariya and the night.\nMariya arrives, and flirts with him, but her thoughts turn darker - why is he spending so much time away from her of late? Why did he toast Poltava the other night? Who is she? She gave up everything for him - if he rejected her now... Mazeppa tries to calm her, unsuccessfully at first, but eventually succeeds. He reveals his plan to gain independence for Ukraine, making himself King and Mariya queen. Mariya thinks the crown would suit him very well. He then begins testing her out about her father - who does she care for more - her husband or her family? Eventually Mariya says she would give up - indeed, has given up, everything for him. Mazeppa leaves, reassured.\nLyubov arrives, and pleads with Mariya to go to Mazeppa to save Kochubey - only she can save him. Mariya, not knowing anything about it, takes some time to figure out what was going on, but then is horrified and faints, unable to bear it. Lyubov shakes her awake - the procession is already leaving. The two run off in an attempt to plead with Mazeppa for Kochubey's life.\nScene 3: By the town ramparts\nThe poor of the city have gathered for the execution, but their grim fears for Kochubey and hatred of Mazeppa are interrupted by a drunken Cossack singing a cheery little folk song. Mazeppa and Orlik arrive, Kochubey and Iskra are dragged on as prisoners and pray to God to forgive them. They are dragged to the stocks - the crowd gathers round - The axes are raised. Mariya and Lyubov arrive - just in time to see the axes fall. Lyubov rejects Mariya, who collapses in tears as the grim final chords of the chorus echo over the stage.

Horsemen approach and he hides.\nMazeppa and Orlik are fleeing the battle, Mazeppa brooding over having once been powerful, but now, in one day, having lost everything. He sends Orlik off to prepare camp. Andrei springs out and challenges Mazeppa with his sword. Mazeppa warns Andrei he is armed. Andrei charges at him, sword waving... and Mazeppa shoots him.\nMariya arrives, completely mad. She does not recognise Mazeppa, and has convinced herself that her father's trick was just a joke played on her by her mother. But she sees blood everywhere. Mazeppa tries to comfort her - she starts to be, and babbles to him, but then sees blood on his face, and apologises: She had thought him someone else, but the person she thought he was had white hair, and his is covered with blood. Orlik returns and warns Mazeppa that troops approach - Mazeppa wants to take Mariya, but Orlik points out she'd slow them down. He asks whether Mazeppa cares more for a mad woman or his own head, and Mazeppa reluctantly leaves Mariya behind.\nMariya finds Andrei, and the blood on him - she cries out at finding blood everywhere, and remembers \"dreams\" of an execution. Andrei stirs, not quite dead, and Mariya mistakes him for a young child. He begs Mariya to look at him so he can see her face one last time - but she is in her own world, and just sings a lullaby to him, not realising what's happening or who he is.

All the world knows that he has awarded the apple to Venus, and Helen realizes that it is 'la fatalit\u00e9' (fatality) that has sent her 'l'homme \u00e0\u00a0 la pomme' (the man with the apple). The Trojan prince is crowned victor by Helen, to the disgust of the lout Achilles and the two bumbling Ajaxes. Paris is invited to a banquet by Menelaus, 'l'\u00e9poux de la reine, poux de la reine, poux de la reine' (Helen's spouse and louse). Paris has bribed Calchas to have Philocomus strike the thunder gong and to prophesy that Menelaus must at once proceed to Crete, at which point the chorus breaks into a joyful song, repeating over and over again 'Va, suis, M\u00e9n\u00e9las \/ La voix du destin \/ Qui te m\u00e8ne, h\u00e9las! \/ Au pays cr\u00e9tain!'

Although she knows her fate, she seemingly resists him, and he uses strategy. He departs, but returns when she has fallen asleep. He tells Helen that what will now occur is only a dream, and she is content to risk all with this understanding at this moment. Menelaus unexpectedly returns and finds the two in each other's arms.

Balducci would have preferred Fieramosca as the chosen sculptor, and also because he hopes to marry his daughter Teresa to Fieramosca. But Teresa is smitten with Cellini. Before Balducci goes to his meeting with the Pope, Cellini and other Carnival celebrators come on the scene, and pelt Balducci with fausses drag\u00e9es (flour pellets) that make Balducci look \"like a leopard\". He can't clean himself off, however, so he continues to his meeting.\nA bouquet of flowers comes through the window and lands at Teresa's feet. Attached is a note from Cellini saying that he is coming up. He does so, and explains his plan to take her away from her father so that they can live together. He and his assistant Ascanio will be disguised as monks, and will take her from her father during the Mardi Gras celebrations, when the Castel Sant'Angelo cannon is sounded to mark the end of Carnival. Unbeknownst to them both, Fieramosca has also entered the room, and tries to eavesdrop on them. He does not hear all the information on the first rendition, but he does on the second.\nUpon hearing Balducci approach, Fieramosca hides in Teresa's bedroom, and Cellini hides behind the main room door. To distract her father, Teresa invents a story about a noise in her bedroom. Balducci goes into her bedroom, and Cellini escapes in the meantime. To Teresa's surprise, Balducci produces Fieramosca from the bedroom. He and Teresa call on the servants and neighbors to take Fieramosca and dump him outside in the fountain, but Fieramosca breaks free of the crowd.\nTableau 2 (Piazza Colonna)\nCellini, his apprentices and friends sing the praises of being goldsmiths. Bernardino asks for more wine, but the innkeeper demands settlement of their tab. Ascanio then appears with the Pope's advance payment for the Perseus statue, but also with a warning that the casting of the statue must occur the next day. The amount of money in the advance is less than expected, which gives new impetus to the plan to mock Balducci at Cassandro's booth that night.\nFieramosca has also overheard this plan, and confides to his friend Pompeo. Pompeo suggests that they too disguise themselves as monks and abduct Teresa themselves.\nPeople gather in the piazza. A crowd assembles at Cassandro's booth, where \"the pantomime-opera of King Midas or The Ass's Ears\" is unfurled. Balducci and Teresa enter, soon after Cellini and Ascanio dressed as monks, and then Fieramosca and Pompeo similarly disguised. In the pantomime, Harlequin and Pierrot compete for the attention of King Midas, who is attired to look like Balducci. At this, the real Balducci approaches the stage, leaving Teresa alone. Both sets of \"friars\" then approach Teresa, to her confusion. The four friars begin to battle by sword, and in the struggle, Cellini fatally stabs Pompeo. The crowd becomes silent, and Cellini is arrested for murder. As he is about to be taken away, the three cannon shots from Castel Sant'Angelo are heard, indicating the end of Carnival and the start of Lent. All of the lights in the piazza are extinguished. During the darkness and resulting confusion, Cellini escapes his captors and Ascanio and Teresa go off. Fieramosca is then mistakenly arrested in Cellini's place.\n Act 2\nTableau 1 (Ash Wednesday, Cellini's studio)\nAscanio and Teresa wait for Cellini in his studio. When a procession of friars passes by, they join in the prayer. Cellini then enters, still in monk's disguise, and recounts his escape. Because he is now wanted for murder, he plans to escape Florence with Teresa, but Ascanio reminds him of his obligation to cast the statue. Ascanio goes off to find a horse. Balducci and Fieramosca then appear. Balducci denounces Cellini as a murderer and then promises Teresa to Fieramosca in marriage.\nThe Pope then appears to check on the progress of the statue. Cellini makes excuses, but the Pope dismisses them and decides that he will give the commission to another sculptor. Cellini then threatens to destroy the mould, and when the Pope's guards approach him, he raises his hammer. The Pope then makes Cellini an offer: if Cellini can cast the statue that evening, he will forgive Cellini's crimes and let him marry Teresa. But if Cellini fails, he will be hanged.\nTableau 2 (Ash Wednesday, evening, Cellini's foundry)\nAfter an aria from Ascanio, Cellini comes on stage and muses on the quiet life of a shepherd. The workmen are at their labours and sing a sea-shanty, which Cellini sees as a bad omen. Ascanio and Cellini encourage the goldsmiths to continue their work. Fieramosca then arrives with two henchmen and challenges Cellini to a duel. Cellini accepts and asks to settle it on the spot, but Fieramosca prefers it to be done away from his workplace. Fieramosca and his men leave.\nTeresa arrives and sees Ascanio hand Cellini his rapier, but Cellini assures her that he will be safe. Alone, she hears the workmen start to lay down their tools and stop work, as they have not been paid and lack direction from Cellini. She tries to assure them that they will be paid eventually, but to no avail. Fieramosca then appears, and Teresa faints, thinking that Cellini is dead. This is not so, as Fieramosca is about to offer a bribe to the goldsmiths to cease work completely. This turns the goldsmiths against Fieramosca and they reassert their loyalty to Cellini. Cellini then reappears, and he and the workmen force Fieramosca to don workclothes to help out.\nIn the evening, the Pope and Balducci arrive to see if the statue is completed. Fieramosca then announces that they are out of metal, which Francesco and Bernardino confirm. Balducci and Fieramosca are pleased at Cellini's impending failure. Cellini then prays, and in a moment of desperation, orders that all art works in his studio, of whatever metal, be put into the crucible and melted, to the consternation of Francesco and Bernardino. After this is done, an explosion blows the lid off the crucible. Then molten metal emerges to fill the mould, and the casting is successful. Balducci and Fieramosca acknowledge Cellini's success.

He decides to take it to the king, thinking that he will be rewarded for being a loyal subject. His wise daughter tells him not to, because the king will throw him in the dungeons thinking that he has stolen the pestle, which in truth he didn't find.\n\tThe daughter's prediction comes true, and this is the beginning of the opera. When the king learns that the daughter had wisely known what his actions would be he sends for her to come before him. He tells her she has \"talked a noose around her neck\" and will give her two choices for how to save her life. She can either gamble for it, or answer 3 riddles.\n\tThe wise daughter chooses to answer the 3 riddles, and saves her life. The king makes her his queen and all seems happy.\n\tThe opera is only half over though. Three scoundrels have stirred up some trouble between the owners of a donkey and of a mule. One morning they found a baby donkey between the two beasts, and the mule owner ridiculously thought it could be his. The king agrees that since the baby was closer to the mule it must belong to it. The queen overhears this and sets up the donkey owner to show the king the error of his foolish judgment. The king realizes that his new wife is mocking him and working against his decision and he sends her away with a large box and tells her to take whatever she wishes and leave. The queen drugs her husband with opiates in his wine, and the opera happily ends with him waking up inside the box, and acknowledging that she truly is a wise woman. She contradicts him and says that no one who loves can be truly wise.

They are warned by Lt. Schrank and Officer Krupke to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance, but some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty (\"Jet Song\"). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Loyal to Riff, Tony agrees, but he wants no further part of gang life and imagines a better future (\"Something's Coming\").\n\tMaria works in a bridal shop with Anita, the girlfriend of her brother, Bernardo. Maria has just arrived from Puerto Rico, and her family has selected Chino, a member of the Sharks, to be her future husband. Anita makes Maria a dress to wear to the neighborhood dance.\n\tIn the bridal shop, Maria has not heard the news and daydreams happily about seeing Tony with her friends-Rosalia, Consuelo, Teresita and Francisca (\"I Feel Pretty\"). Just then, Chino brings the news that Tony has killed Bernardo. Maria flees to her bedroom, praying that Chino is mistaken. Tony arrives to see Maria, and in a fit of rage she throws her fists at him until he finally calms her down and they plan to run away together; as the walls of Maria's bedroom disappear, they find themselves in a dreamlike world of peace (\"Somewhere\").\n\tThe Jets try their hardest to get their minds off the death of Riff by poking fun at all of the adults who try to make sense of what they do (\"Gee, Officer Krupke\"). The Jets make Action leader of the gang. Anybodys brings news that she overheard Chino planning to hunt down Tony and kill him with a gun. The Jets then spread out to find Tony and protect him from Chino. They also accept Anybodys into the Jets. Anybodys falls in love with Action.\n\tA grieving Anita arrives at Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria to meet him at Doc's so they can run away to the country. Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and asks in horror how she can love the man who killed her brother (\"A Boy Like That\"). Maria responds passionately with her own song (\"I Have a Love\"), though, and Anita understands that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony.\n\tLt. Schrank arrives to question Maria, and Anita reluctantly agrees to go to Doc's to tell Tony to wait. At the store, the Jets taunt Anita with racist innuendo and insults. The taunts turn into physical abuse, and Doc returns to the store horrified to find the boys nearly raping Anita. In her anger, Anita, who is in tears, tells the Jets that Bernardo was right about them, and then claims that Chino has killed Maria in jealousy. Anita rushes out of the store. Doc relates the news to Tony, who has been dreaming of heading to the countryside to have children with Maria. Feeling there is no longer anything to live for, Tony leaves to find Chino, begging for him to die as well. Just as Tony sees Maria alive, Chino arrives and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks, and adults flock around the lovers. Maria holds Tony in her arms (and sings a quiet, brief reprise of \"Somewhere\") as he dies. Angry at the death of another friend, the Jets move towards the Sharks but Maria takes Chino's gun and tells everyone that hatred is what killed Tony and the others, and now she can kill, because now she hates, too. However, she is unable to bring herself to fire the gun and drops it, crying in grief. Gradually, all the members of both gangs assemble on either side of Tony's body, showing that the feud is over. The Jets and Sharks form a procession, and together they carry Tony away with Maria being the last one in the procession."},{"opera_title":"Chovantsjina","composer":"Modest Mussorgsky","synopsis":"Time: The year 1682\n\tPlace: Moscow\n\tTheme: The principal theme of Khovanshchina is stated outright in the choral number \"Akh, ty Rodnaya, Matushka Russ\" (\"Oh poor Motherland\"), which laments that Russia is bleeding and dying not because of a foreign enemy, but because of fragmentation within. Something like a three-way civil war is in progress, which basically compresses twelve years of Russian history into one telling. Tsar Peter is modernizing, and two powerful forces are resisting his changes: the Streltsy and the Old Believers. The Streltsy are decommissioned elite soldiers\/guards (\"Streltsy\" literally means \"shooters\", just like \"musketeers\"), past their prime and on indefinite furlough. They are fanatically loyal to Prince Ivan Khovansky. The Old Believers are Russian Orthodox Christians who have left the state-sponsored church because it went along with Tsar Peter's changes, they also challenge the line of succession to the throne and have denied the Russian Patriarch because of various religious motives. Their leader is Dosifey. Fortunately for Tsar Peter, these two factions despise each other, as the Streltsy are rowdy degenerates and the Old Believers are pious ascetics. Each of the three principal basses in the opera believes himself to represent the \"true\" Russia against her internal enemies: Prince Ivan Khovansky by noble birth and military prowess, Dosefei by religion, and Shaklovity by supporting Tsar Peter.\n\tHistorical background: The death of the young Tsar Fyodor III has left Russia with a crisis of succession. Supported by Prince Ivan Khovansky, Fyodor's sickly brother Ivan and his half-brother Peter, both still in their teens, have been installed as joint rulers, with their older sister Sophia acting as regent. Sophia has allied herself with Prince Vasily Golitsin, a powerful courtier and liberal politician, who is also her lover.\n\tDue to regulations applicable at the time of the composition of the opera in Imperial Russia, it was forbidden to portray members of the Romanov dynasty on stage, so Mussorgsky had recourse to a series of symbols and indirect mention of main characters in the plot.\n\tIn some performances and recordings of the opera some segments are deleted, depending on the intepretation of the original notes, which are described in .\n\tAct 1\n\tA pine forest, a secluded monastery, a moonlit night\n\tDosifey and his followers have taken refuge in a hermitage in the forest. Although he is weighed down by the sorrows and sufferings of the brethren, he remains defiant and determined to win a \"crown of glory\" in fire and flame (\"Here, in this holy place\"). He exhorts the brethren to don white clothing and light candles, preparing for immolation. They enter the hermitage. Prince Andrey Khovansky enters, singing of his lost love, still seeking Emma. Marfa sings to him, reminding him of their own love, and assuring him that she will not leave him. Dosifey and the brethren return, dressed in white and carrying candles. They build a funeral pyre. Offstage trumpet calls herald the approach of Tsar Peter's soldiers. Marfa sings to Andrey of the hopelessness of their situation. The trumpet calls sound again. Dosifey exhorts the brethren to remain strong one last time. Marfa lights the pyre. The schismatics sing a final hymn (\"God will save me\"). As Dosifey, Marfa, Prince Andrey Khovansky, and the Old Believers perish in the flames, Tsar Peter's Preobrazhensky soldiers arrive in a vain attempt to capture them."},{"opera_title":"Vielka","composer":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","synopsis":"The opera is set during the Third Silesian War, a part of the larger Seven Years' War."},{"opera_title":"Maria Padilla","composer":"Gaetano Donizetti","synopsis":"Place: CastileTime: 14th century\nMaria tells her sister Ines that she hopes to marry Don Pedro, the ruler of Castile.

The \"Argument\" to the opera provides the context of the events that precede the opera.\n Prologue\nOttone's father had sent him to Italy to fight the Greeks in their battle for Italy. Ottone prevailed over the Greeks, and the Saracens as well. Having obtained a peace agreement with the Greeks, he acquired as his fianc\u00e9e Teofane, the daughter of Romano, the Eastern Emperor. Basilio, Theophane's brother, had been driven into exile by \"the Tyrant\" Nicephoro, until his recall, years later, by Zemisces to assist in governing the empire. However, Basilio had become a pirate during his exile, and took on the name of Emireno. Unaware of Ottone's victories, he gave chase to the escort which was transporting Teofane back to Rome, and was captured. Meanwhile, Adelberto, son of the \"Tyrant in Italy\" Berengario, under the influence of his mother Gismonda, instigated a rebellion by Rome against the Germans. The \"Argument\" acknowledged these events as historical.\nThe \"Argument\" then went on to mention the fictional events for dramatic purposes initiating from the capture of Teofane by Adelberto, and that Teofane falls in love with Adelberto while he is incognito in Constantinople.\n Act 1\nAfter Gismonda has instigated the rebellion, she persuades Adelberto to pose as Ottone as he tries to win Teofane over. Teofane had, prior to this, fallen in love with Ottone's portrait, and when she meets Adelberto (as Ottone), the discrepancy in the appearances disconcerts her. Meanwhile, the captured Emireno continues to conceal his identity from Ottone. Matilda, cousin of Ottone and the fianc\u00e9e of Adelberto, demands troops to avenge Adelberto's revolt and betrayed faith. Praising Matilda as a \"brave German Amazon\", Ottone assents. Adelberto is on the brink of winning Teofane's hand, but then learns that Ottone is drawing near. Gismonda arms Adelberto and sends him off into battle.\n Act 2\nAdelberto has been captured. In the meantime, Matilda's attitude toward Adelberto has begun to soften, and she has a meeting with Gismonda. Later, she visits Ottone just before he and Teofane are to meet for the first time, and she begs for mercy on behalf of Adelberto. Ottone disdains the request, but embraces Adelberto out of pity. Teofane sees this and jumps to the conclusion that he is unfaithful.\nThe next scene is in a garden near the River Tiber, at night. From an underground passage, Emireno and Adelberto have escaped, with the presumed surreptitious assistance of Matilda. Before a boat manned by several of Emireno's men leads them off, Emireno has abducted Teofane, who was walking dejectedly in the garden and faints upon being captured. Gismonda and Matilda are pleased that the night has furthered their plans.\n Act 3\nGismonda is gloating over Ottone's misfortunes. A storm has caused Emireno and Adelberto to put in to land. Emireno then realises who Teofane is, but continues to conceal his own identity. He does try to embrace her, but Teofane and Adelberto look upon this as some sort of advance on her. Emireno orders the arrest of Adelberto, and tries to calm Teofane's suspicions, but leaves without giving a full explanation. Teofane prays for death.\nMatilda then explains to Ottone about Teofane's capture. Gismonda, in turn, says that Matilda had helped in the escape of Emireno and Adelberto. Matilda becomes remorseful. Adelberto then is brought in, in chains. Matilda thinks of stabbing Adelberto, but her resolve fails. Contemptuous of this weakness, Gismonda tries to take her own life, but the arrival of Teofane stops this. The entire situation becomes unravelled. In the end, Ottone is united with Teofane. Gismonda and Adelberto must abase themselves. In a sudden change, Matilda consents to marry Adelberto."},{"opera_title":"Intermezzo","composer":"Richard Strauss","synopsis":"Setting: Vienna and Grundlsee during a 1920's winter\nThe conductor Robert Storch is about to conduct a concert one night.
