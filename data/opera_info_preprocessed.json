The light, energetic overture has been in the standard repertoire since its premiere as La Cenerentola.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/rossini\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/rossini\/la-cenerentola\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/rossini\/la-cenerentola\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"L' Orfeo","composer":"Claudio Monteverdi","librettist":"Alessandro Striggio, junior","premiere":"24 February 1607, Mantua (Palazzo Ducale)","language":"Italian","summary":"L'Orfeo (SV 318), sometimes called L'Orfeo, favola in musica, is an early Baroque opera by Claudio Monteverdi, with a libretto by Alessandro Striggio. It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus, and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world. Written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua, L'Orfeo is one of the earliest music dramas still regularly performed.Within the musical theatre at the beginning of the 17th century the traditional intermedio\u00e2\u20ac\u201da musical sequence between the acts of a straight play\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or \"opera\". Monteverdi's L'Orfeo moved this process out of its experimental era, and provided the first fully developed example within the new genre. After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua, and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years. Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615. After the composer's death in 1643 the opera remained unperformed, and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances. At first these tended to be unstaged versions within institutes and music societies, but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris, in 1911, the work was seen increasingly in theatres. After the Second World War most new editions sought authenticity through the use of period instruments. Many recordings were issued, and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses. In 2007 the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/monteverdi\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/monteverdi\/l'-orfeo\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/monteverdi\/l'-orfeo\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"Don Pasquale","composer":"Gaetano Donizetti","librettist":"Gaetano Donizetti, and Giacomo Ruffini","premiere":"3 January 1843, Paris (Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien)","language":"Italian","summary":"Don Pasquale is an opera buffa, or comic opera, in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti with an Italian libretto by Giovanni Ruffini and the composer after Angelo Anelli's libretto for Stefano Pavesi's Ser Marc'Antonio (1810).At the time of its composition, Donizetti had just been appointed music director and composer for the imperial court of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, and Don Pasquale was the 64th of an eventual 66 operas he composed.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/donizetti\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/donizetti\/don-pasquale\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/donizetti\/don-pasquale\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"Lucia di Lammermoor","composer":"Gaetano Donizetti","librettist":"Salvatore Cammarano","premiere":"26 Septemberr 1835, Naples (Teatro San Carlo)","language":"Italian","summary":"Lucia di Lammermoor is a dramma tragico (tragic opera) in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti.

Set in ancient times on the island of Ceylon, the opera is a story of how two men's vow of eternal friendship is threatened by their love for the same woman, whose own dilemma is the conflict between secular love and her sacred oath as a priestess. The friendship duet \"Au fond du temple saint\", generally known as \"The Pearl Fishers Duet\", is one of the best-known numbers in Western opera.At the time of the premiere, Bizet was 25 years old and had yet to establish himself in the Parisian musical world. The commission to write Les p\u00eacheurs arose from his standing as a former winner of the prestigious Prix de Rome. Despite a good reception by the public, press reactions to the work were generally hostile and dismissive, although other composers, notably Hector Berlioz, found considerable merit in the music. The opera was not revived in Bizet's lifetime, but from 1886 onwards it was performed with some regularity in Europe and America, and from the mid-20th century has entered the repertory of opera houses worldwide. Because the autograph score was lost, post-1886 productions were based on amended versions of the score that contained significant departures from the original. However, since the 1970s, efforts have been made to reconstruct the score in accordance with Bizet's intentions.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/bizet\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/bizet\/les-p\u00eacheurs-de-perles\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/bizet\/les-p\u00eacheurs-de-perles\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"Romeo et Juliette","composer":"Charles Gounod","librettist":"Jules Barbier, and Michel Carr\u00e9","premiere":"27 April 1867, Paris (Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique)","language":"French","summary":"Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (Romeo and Juliet) is an op\u00e9ra in five acts by Charles Gounod to a French libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carr\u00e9, based on The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare.

S. Gilbert and music by Arthur Sullivan. It was the British duo's third operatic collaboration. The plot of The Sorcerer is based on a Christmas story, An Elixir of Love, that Gilbert wrote for The Graphic magazine in 1876. A young man, Alexis, is obsessed with idea of love levelling all ranks and social distinctions. To promote his beliefs, he invites the proprietor of J. W. Wells & Co., Family Sorcerers, to brew a love potion. This causes everyone in the village to fall in love with the first person they see and results in the pairing of comically mismatched couples. In the end, Wells must sacrifice himself to break the spell.The opera opened on 17 November 1877 at the Opera Comique in London, where it ran for 178 performances. It was considered a success by the standards of that time and encouraged the collaborators to write their next opera, H.M.S. Pinafore. The Sorcerer was revised for an 1884 revival, and it is in that version that it is usually performed today. The Sorcerer was the first Savoy opera for which the author and composer had nearly total control over the production and the selection of cast. Several of the actors chosen went on on to create principal roles in most of the later Gilbert and Sullivan operas. It was their first opera to use all the major character types and typical range of songs that would appear in their later collaborations, such as comic duets, a patter song, a contrapuntal double chorus, a tenor and soprano love duet, a soprano showpiece and so forth.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/sullivan\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/sullivan\/the-sorcerer\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/sullivan\/the-sorcerer\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"Die Dreigroschenoper","composer":"Kurt Weill","librettist":"Bertold Brecht based on the translation by Elisabeth Hauptmann of \"The Beggar's Opera\"","premiere":"31 August 1928, Berlin (Theater am Schiffbauerdamm","language":"German","summary":"The Threepenny Opera (German: Die Dreigroschenoper) is a musical by German dramatist Bertolt Brecht and composer Kurt Weill, in collaboration with translator Elisabeth Hauptmann and set designer Caspar Neher.

Frederic finds out, however, that he was born on 29 February, and so, technically, he only has a birthday each leap year. His apprenticeship indentures state that he remains apprenticed to the pirates until his 21st birthday, and so he must serve for another 63 years. Bound by his own sense of duty, Frederic's only solace is that Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/sullivan\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/sullivan\/the-pirates-of-penzance\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/sullivan\/the-pirates-of-penzance\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"Amico Fritz","composer":"Pietro Mascagni","librettist":"P.

The work has been variously described as a serenata, a masque, a pastoral or pastoral opera, a \"little opera\" (in a letter by the composer while it was being written), an entertainment and in the New Grove Dictionary of Music an oratorio. The work was originally devised as a one act masque which premiered in 1718. Handel later adapted the piece into a three act serenata for the Italian opera troupe in London in 1732, which incorporated a number of songs (still in Italian) from Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, his 1708 setting of the same story to different music. He later adapted the original English work into a two act work in 1739.\r\n\tAcis and Galatea was the pinnacle of pastoral opera in England. Indeed several writers, such as musicologist Stanley Sadie, consider it the greatest pastoral opera ever composed. As is typical of the genre, Acis and Galatea was written as a courtly entertainment about the simplicity of rural life and contains a significant amount of wit and self-parody. The secondary characters, Polyphemus and Damon, provide a significant amount of humor without diminishing the pathos of the tragedy of the primary characters, Acis and Galatea. The music of the first act is both elegant and sensual, while the final act takes on a more melancholy and plaintive tone. Unique among Handel's compositional output, the opera was significantly influenced by the pastoral operas presented at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane during the early 18th century. Reinhard Keiser and Henry Purcell also served as influences, but overall the conception and execution of the work is wholly individual to Handel.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/handel\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/handel\/acis-and-galatea\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/handel\/acis-and-galatea\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"Il Corsaro","composer":"Giuseppe Verdi","librettist":"Francesco Maria Piave","premiere":"25 October 1848, Trieste (Teatro Grande)","language":"Italian","summary":"Il corsaro (The Corsair) is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi, from a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave, based on Lord Byron's poem The Corsair.

These types of short pieces were popular in Venice at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. The pieces were intimate, with a cast of five to eight singers, always including a pair of lovers, here Sofia and Florville, at least two comic parts, here Bruschino senior, Gaudenzio and Filiberto, and one or more minor roles, here Marianna, Bruschino junior and a policeman. The style called for much visual comedy improvised by the players, and often a compulsive linguistic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctic'. Here, Bruschino senior often repeats the phrase \"Oh, it's so hot!\".

The story, taken from the second half of Homer's Odyssey, tells how constancy and virtue are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome. After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors have seized the realm and are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope. With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers his kingdom.\r\n\tIl ritorno is the first of three full-length works which Monteverdi wrote for the burgeoning Venetian opera industry during the last five years of his life. After its initial successful run in Venice the opera was performed in Bologna before returning to Venice for the 1640-41 season. Thereafter, except for a possible performance at the Imperial court in Vienna late in the 17th century, there were no further revivals until the 20th century. The music became known in modern times through the 19th century discovery of an incomplete manuscript score which differs in many respects from the surviving versions of the libretto. After its publication in 1922 the score's authenticity was widely questioned, and performances of the opera remained rare during the next 30\u00a0years. By the 1950s the work was generally accepted as Monteverdi's, and after revivals in Vienna and Glyndebourne in the early 1970s it became increasingly popular.

According to Neal Zaslaw, Cimarosa's librettist may have been Giuseppe Petrosellini, the house poet of the Teatro Valle where Le donne rivali premiered. (Petrosellini was also the probable librettist of Mozart's earlier opera La finta giardiniera). For Lo sposo deluso, Mozart had the characters in Le donne rivali expanded from five to seven, renamed the original five, and established the cast of singers for whom he would be writing. It is unclear why he abandoned the work, although Zaslaw has proposed that it was a combination of the difficulties presented by re-writing and adapting the libretto for the Viennese audience and the fact that in 1785, Da Ponte had finally come through with the libretto for Le nozze di Figaro.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/mozart\/","synopsis_link":null,"libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/mozart\/lo-sposo-deluso\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"Spitzentuch der K\u00f6nigin","composer":"Johann Strauss jr","librettist":null,"premiere":null,"language":"German","summary":"Das Spitzentuch der K\u00f6nigin (The Queen's Lace Handkerchief) is an operetta by Johann Strauss II.

It was presented only 9 times in its initial production, but was a succ\u00e8s d'estime for the young composer, with the critics praising Act 3 in particular. It was later revived in 2-act (1858) and 4-act (1884) versions, achieving a total of 48 performances.The impetus for the composition of Gounod's first opera, and its acceptance for performance at France's premiere opera house, was primarily due to the influence of Pauline Viardot, who met the young composer in January or February 1850, shortly after her triumph there in Meyerbeer's Le proph\u00e8te. In his memoirs Gounod relates that the violinist Fran\u00e7ois Seghers, who at that time was the leader of the Concerts de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Sainte-C\u00e9cile on the Rue Chauss\u00e9e-d'Antin, had presented some pieces by Gounod which had made a favorable impression. The Viardot family knew Seghers and through him Gounod received an invitation to play several of his compositions on the piano so they could hear them. After several hours Pauline Viardot asked Gounod why he had not yet written an opera. He responded that he did not have a libretto. When she asked with whom he might like to work, he mentioned that although he had known Augier in childhood, the latter had now become far more famous than he and would hardly care to risk working with someone with whom he had only played hoops. Viardot immediately told Gounod to seek out Augier and tell him that she would take the responsibility to sing the principal role in Gounod's opera, if Augier would write the poem. Gounod also says that Viardot recommended his opera to the director of the company, who at that time was Nestor Roqueplan. According to her daughter, Viardot made renewal of her contract for the 1850-1851 season at the Op\u00e9ra conditional on a commission for Augier and Gounod. In any case, the contract between Augier, Gounod, and Roqueplan, which was dated 1 April 1850, specified a 2-act opera to be provided by 30 September 1850 and performed no later than 1 April 1851.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/gounod\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/gounod\/sappho\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":null},{"opera_title":"Rosmonda d'Inghiliterra","composer":"Gaetano Donizetti","librettist":null,"premiere":null,"language":"Italian","summary":"Rosmonda d'Inghilterra (Rosamund of England) is a melodramma or opera in two acts by Gaetano Donizetti.

The story takes place near the rural town of Plo\u00ebrmel and is based on two Breton tales by \u00c9mile Souvestre, \"La Chasse aux tr\u00e9sors\" and \"Le Kacouss de l'Armor\", both published separately in 1850 in the R\u00e9vue des deux mondes.The opera was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique (Salle Favart), in Paris, on April 4, 1859 under the title Le pardon de Plo\u00ebrmel.

Those for the more technically demanding Act 2, which included onstage running water, were by Joseph and Karl Wilhelm M\u00fchldorfer. The principal singers were highly acclaimed: \"Marie Cabel for her vertiginous-virtuoso interpretation of Dinorah; Sainte-Foy for his overwhelmingly convincing characterization of Corentin, lyrically as well as dramatically; Jean-Baptiste Faure for his fascinating stage presence as Ho\u00ebl, Meyerbeer's first big baritone role.\" The supporting singers were also greatly admired, in particular, Barreille as the huntsman and Warot as the harvester. Meyerbeer's music was praised for its originality, but the libretto was found incomprehensible and even met with derision. In the initial run of performances up to the end of 1859, changes were made, the most significant being the casting of the contralto Palmyre Wertheimber in the role of Ho\u00ebl.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/meyerbeer\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/meyerbeer\/le-pardon-de-plo\u00ebrmel\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":null},{"opera_title":"Old maid and thief","composer":"Gian Menotti","librettist":"Gian-Carlo Menotti","premiere":null,"language":"English","summary":"The Old Maid and the Thief is an opera in one act by Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti.

Only 40 minutes long and with cast of two singers, Zanetto was originally described by its composer as a scena lirica (lyric scene) rather than an opera. It is set in the countryside near Florence during the Renaissance and tells the story of an encounter between a beautiful courtesan, Silvia, and a young wandering minstrel, Zanetto. The libretto was adapted from an Italian translation by Emilio Praga of Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e's play Le passant (The passer-by) in which the young Sarah Bernhardt had won fame in the en travesti role of Zanetto.Zanetto represented a return by Mascagni to the one-act format of his first opera Cavalleria rusticana, which had premiered in 1890. However, the Renaissance setting of Zanetto was a far cry from the gritty contemporary story he used for Cavalleria rusticana, the work that made him famous. By 1893, Mascagni was simultaneously working on three operas: Vistilia, based on a novel by Rocco de Zerbi set in ancient Rome; Guglielmo Ratcliff, which he had first started composing in 1882; and Zanetto, which his publisher, Edoardo Sonzogno, envisioned being performed in future double bills with Cavalleria. Mascagni finally finished Zanetto in October 1895. It was premiered on 2 March 1896 as part of the annual celebrations in honour of Rossini's birthday at the Liceo Musicale Rossini in Pesaro, where Mascagni was now the director. Two of the conservatory's students, Maria Pizzagalli and Stefania Collamarini, sang the roles of Silvia and Zanetto. The opera was then staged at La Scala on 18 March with the same cast. Although the opera had been enthusiastically received in Pesaro, the reception at La Scala was lukewarm.

The German libretto is by Ernst Benjamin Salomo Raupach. It was first staged at the K\u00f6nigliches Opernhaus, Berlin on 12 June 1829. Raupach categorised Agnes von Hohenstaufen as a historical-romantic opera and it is one of a number of German works of the time set in the Middle Ages (others include Weber's Euryanthe, Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user and Lohengrin and Schumann's Genoveva). Agnes also contains many of the features that would be characteristic of French Grand Opera. Spontini substantially reworked the piece for a revival in 1837.The action concerns the struggle between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI (Heinrich VI) and the leader of the noble Welf faction, Henry the Lion (Heinrich der L\u00f6we). The first act is set in Mainz where the emperor has assembled his forces to march against the Welfs. Agnes of Hohenstaufen, the emperor's cousin, is engaged to be married to the son of Henry the Lion, Henry \"Palatinus\", but the war brings this alliance into doubt. Henry arrives at Mainz disguised as a troubadour. The French ambassador proposes that Agnes should be married to his king, Philip II Augustus (Philipp August), instead. The emperor agrees and the betrothal is announced at a banquet. Henry, unable to bear the French ambassador's flirting with Agnes, is moved to anger and his true identity is revealed. The emperor condemns him to death and banishes Agnes to a convent. This highhandedness provokes a mutiny amongst some of the nobles.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/spontini\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/spontini\/agnes-von-hohenstaufen\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/spontini\/agnes-von-hohenstaufen\/libretto\/"},{"opera_title":"The Bohemian Girl","composer":"Michael William Balfe","librettist":"Alfred Bunn","premiere":null,"language":"English","summary":"The Bohemian Girl is an opera composed by Michael William Balfe with a libretto by Alfred Bunn.

Bernstein, however, was so excited about this idea that he convinced Hellman to do it as a \"comic operetta\"; she then wrote the original libretto for the operetta. Many lyricists worked on the show: first James Agee (whose work was ultimately not used), then Dorothy Parker, John Latouche and Richard Wilbur.

Circumstances divided them, and Pauline gave her heart to Polyeucte, an Armenian Prince. At the opening the Christian faith is being propagated in Melitene, and Polyeucte has listened with a willing ear to the teachings of the new creed. Naturally the converts are subject to persecution, and a butchering is anticipated, when S\u00e9v\u00e8re, who is approaching Melitene, after a successful campaign, enters in triumph.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/gounod\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/gounod\/polyeucto\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":null},{"opera_title":"Maria Regina d'Inghilterra","composer":"Giovanni Pacini","librettist":null,"premiere":null,"language":"Italian","summary":"Maria, regina d'Inghilterra (Mary Tudor, Queen of England) is an Italian opera in three acts, composed by Giovanni Pacini from a libretto by Leopoldo Tarantini, which was based on the play Marie Tudor by Victor Hugo.

The members of the Sharks from Puerto Rico are taunted by the Jets, a white working-class group. The young protagonist, Tony, one of the Jets, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, and focus on social problems marked a turning point in American musical theatre. Bernstein's score for the musical has become extremely popular; it includes \"Something's Coming\", \"Maria\", \"America\", \"Somewhere\", \"Tonight\", \"Jet Song\", \"I Feel Pretty\", \"A Boy Like That\", \"One Hand, One Heart\", \"Gee, Officer Krupke\", and \"Cool\".","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/bernstein\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/bernstein\/west-side-story\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":null},{"opera_title":"Chovantsjina","composer":"Modest Mussorgsky","librettist":"Modest Mussorgskij","premiere":"21 February (5 March) 1886, Leningrad (Privat Thea","language":"Russian","summary":"Khovanshchina (Russian: Hov\u00e1n\u0161\u00c4\u008dina, sometimes rendered The Khovansky Affair) is an opera (subtitled a 'national music drama') in five acts by Modest Mussorgsky.

It concerns the rebellion of Prince Ivan Khovansky, the Old Believers, and the Streltsy against Peter the Great, who was attempting to institute Westernizing reforms to Russia. Peter succeeded, the rebellion was crushed and (in the opera, at least) Khovansky's followers committed mass suicide.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/mussorgsky\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/mussorgsky\/chovantsjina\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":null},{"opera_title":"Vielka","composer":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","librettist":null,"premiere":null,"language":"French","summary":"Ein Feldlager in Schlesien (A Camp in Silesia) is a Singspiel in three acts by Giacomo Meyerbeer with a German-language libretto by Ludwig Rellstab after Eug\u00e8ne Scribe's Le champ de Sil\u00e9sie.

Meyerbeer was invited to compose a brand new work for the festive occasion of the reopening of the opera house. The reigning Prussian king at the time was Frederick William IV, of the house of Hohenzollern. What better theme for this opera than a work celebrating the king's famous ancestor, Frederick the Great? But there was one problem, members of the ruling Hohenzollern family could not be depicted on stage. This was not really all that much of a problem, Frederick could still be the subject of the opera, and simply not appear on stage. He is, however, heard playing the flute in the background.","composer_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/meyerbeer\/","synopsis_link":"https:\/\/www.opera-arias.com\/meyerbeer\/vielka\/synopsis\/","libretto_link":null},{"opera_title":"Maria Padilla","composer":"Gaetano Donizetti","librettist":null,"premiere":null,"language":"Italian","summary":"Maria Padilla is a melodramma, or opera, in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti.

Handel had completed the first version on 10 August 1722, but revised the opera before its first performance.The premiere, on 12 January 1723 at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, also marked the London debut of Francesca Cuzzoni as Teofane. The opera was a great success in Handel's lifetime, and received revivals in December 1723, 1726, 1727 and 1733, in some cases with additional music. Ottone also is notable as the only Handel opera in which Farinelli appeared, in the role of Adelberto, in December 1734. In Germany, Ottone was staged in Brunswick (Braunschweig) and Hamburg in the 1720s.
