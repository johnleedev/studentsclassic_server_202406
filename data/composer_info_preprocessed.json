He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers.Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood in Salzburg. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position, always composing abundantly. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons.","opera_list":"Apollo et Hyacinthus\nAscanio in Alba\nBastien und Bastienne\nClemenza di Tito, La\nCosi Fan Tutte\nDon Giovanni\nEntf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail, Die\nFinta giardiniera, La\nFinta semplice, La\nIdomeneo\nLucio Silla\nMitridate, Re di Ponto\nNozze di Figaro, Le\nOca del Cairo, Le\nRe Pastore, Il\nSchauspieldirektor\nZaide (Das Serail)\nSogno di Scipione, Il\nSposo Deluso, Lo\nThamos, K\u00f6nig in \u00c4gypten\nZauberfl\u00f6te, Die\nStein der Weisen"},{"composer":"Giuseppe Verdi","country_of_birth":"Italy","year_of_birth":"1813","death_of_birth":"1901","summary":"Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi (Italian pronunciation:10 October 1813 - 27 January 1901) was an Italian Romantic composer, mainly of opera.

Handel was born in 1685, in a family indifferent to music. He received critical musical training in Halle, Hamburg and Italy before settling in London (1712) and becoming a naturalised British subject in 1727. By then he was strongly influenced by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition.Within fifteen years, Handel, a dramatic genius, started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera, but the public came to hear the vocal bravura of the soloists rather than the music. In 1737 he had a physical breakdown, changed direction creatively and addressed the middle class. As Alexander's Feast (1736) was well received, Handel made a transition to English choral works. After his success with Messiah (1742) he never performed an Italian opera again. Handel was only partly successful with his performances of English Oratorio on mythical or biblical themes, but when he arranged a performance of Messiah to benefit the Foundling Hospital (1750) the critique ended. The pathos of Handel's oratorios is an ethical one. They are hallowed not by liturgical dignity but by the moral ideals of humanity. Almost blind, and having lived in England for almost fifty years, he died a respected and rich man.","opera_list":"Acis and Galatea\nAgrippina\nAlcina\nAriodante\nGiulio Cesare\nGiustino\nIsrael in Egypt\nOrlando\nOttone\nPartenope\nPastorella vaga bella\nPoro\nRinaldo\nRodelinda\nSemele\nTheodora\nTolomeo\nXerxes (Serse)\nAlessandro Severo\nAdmeto"},{"composer":"Giaochino Rossini","country_of_birth":"Italy","year_of_birth":"1792","death_of_birth":"1868","summary":"Gioachino Antonio Rossini (Italian pronunciation:\u00a0 (Giovacchino Antonio Rossini in the baptismal certificate) (29 February 1792 - 13 November 1868) was an Italian composer who wrote 39 operas as well as sacred music, chamber music, songs, and some instrumental and piano pieces.

With a series of radical new works in the 1760s, among them Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste, he broke the stranglehold that Metastasian opera seria had enjoyed for much of the century.The strong influence of French opera in these works encouraged Gluck to move to Paris, which he did in November 1773. Fusing the traditions of Italian opera and the French national genre into a new synthesis, Gluck wrote eight operas for the Parisian stages. One of the last of these, Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride, was a great success and is generally acknowledged to be his finest work.

He is acknowledged by many as one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century.\r\n\tStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev and performed by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911\/1947) and The Rite of Spring (1913) in Paris. The Rite of Spring, which provoked a riot during its premiere, transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His so-called Russian phase was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neoclassical music. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms (concerto grosso, fugue and symphony). They frequently concealed a vein of intense emotion beneath a surface appearance of detachment or austerity and often paid tribute to the music of earlier masters, for example J.S. Bach and Tchaikovsky. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted serial procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note cells and clarity of form, of instrumentation and of utterance.","opera_list":"Mavra\nOedipus Rex\nRake's Progress, The\nRossignol, Le"},{"composer":"Francesco Cilea","country_of_birth":"Italy","year_of_birth":"1866","death_of_birth":"1950","summary":"Francesco Cilea (also Cil\u00e8a) (July 23, 1866 - November 20, 1950) was an Italian composer.

His debut, Hippolyte et Aricie (1733), caused a great stir and was fiercely attacked for its revolutionary use of harmony by the supporters of Lully's style of music. Nevertheless, Rameau's pre-eminence in the field of French opera was soon acknowledged, and he was later attacked as an \"establishment\" composer by those who favoured Italian opera during the controversy known as the Querelle des Bouffons in the 1750s.

Marschner's ability to depict supernatural horror by musical means is especially evident in the first two operas as well as in some of his ballads, such as \"Die Monduhr\" (c.\u00a01839). Next to his operas, his most significant musical contribution is to the Lied, the best of which are comparable with those by Carl Loewe. Marschner also wrote a considerable amount of chamber music, including seven piano trios, as well as unaccompanied male choruses that were very popular in the nineteenth century. While Marschner's operas strongly influenced Wagner, his chamber music, songs, and his cantata Kl\u00e4nge aus Osten (1842) were admired by Robert Schumann, whose cantata Paradise and the Peri (1843) shows the older composer's influence. Marschner's Bagatelles for guitar (1814) have been revived by guitarists, and so have been some of his piano trios. Among his operas, Hans Heiling and especially Der Vampyr have been adapted and revived in recent years with considerable success.Marschner was widely regarded as one of the most important composers in Europe from about 1830 until the end of the 19th century. He was a rival of Weber and friend of Beethoven and Mendelssohn. Even today, he is generally acknowledged as the leading composer of German opera between Weber's death and Wagner, producing many fairy or magic operas with thematic material based on folksong, a genre that had been introduced with Weber's Der Freisch\u00fctz (1821).

Rachmaninoff is widely considered one of the finest pianists of his day and, as a composer, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian classical music. Early influences of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers gave way to a thoroughly personal idiom that included a pronounced lyricism, expressive breadth, structural ingenuity, and a tonal palette of rich, distinctive orchestral colors. The piano is featured prominently in Rachmaninoff's compositional output. He made a point of using his own skills as a performer to explore fully the expressive possibilities of the instrument. Even in his earliest works he revealed a sure grasp of idiomatic piano writing and a striking gift for melody.\r\n\tRachmaninoff was born on 1 April 1873 in Semyonovo, near Great Novgorod, in north-western Russia into a family of the Russian aristocracy, originally of partly Tatar descent, which had been in the service of the Russian tsars since the 16th century. His parents were both amateur pianists. When he was four, his mother gave him casual piano lessons, but it was his paternal grandfather, Arkady Alexandrovich Rachmaninoff, who brought Anna Ornatskaya, a teacher from Saint Petersburg, to teach the 9 year old Sergei in 1882. Ornatskaya remained for two or three years, until the family's house in Semyonovo had to be sold to settle debts and the Rachmaninoffs moved to Saint Petersburg.","opera_list":"Aleko"},{"composer":"Anton Rubinstein","country_of_birth":"Ukraine","year_of_birth":"1829","death_of_birth":"1894","summary":"Anton Grigorevich Rubinstein (Russian: \u00d0\u0090\u00d0\u00bd\u00d1\u201a\u00d0\u00be\u00cc\u0081\u00d0\u00bd \u00d0\u201c\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00be\u00cc\u0081\u00d1\u20ac\u00d1\u0152\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00b2\u00d0\u00b8\u00d1\u2021 \u00d0\u00a0\u00d1\u0192\u00d0\u00b1\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00bd\u00d1\u02c6\u00d1\u201a\u00d0\u00b5\u00cc\u0081\u00d0\u00b9\u00d0\u00bd, tr.

Pacini was born in Catania, Sicily, the son of the buffo Luigi Pacini, who was to appear in the premieres of many of Giovanni's operas. The family was of Tuscan origin, and just happened to be in Catania when the composer was born.His first 25 or so operas were written when Gioacchino Rossini dominated the Italian operatic stage. But Pacini's operas were \"rather superficial\", a fact which, later, he candidly admitted in his Memoirs. For some years he held the post of \"director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.\" Later, retiring to Viareggio to found a school of music, Pacini took time to assess the state of opera in Italy and, during a five-year period during which he stopped composing, laid out his ideas in his Memoirs. Like Saverio Mercadante, who also reassessed the strength and weaknesses of this period in opera, Pacini's style did change, but he quickly became eclipsed by the rising influence of Giuseppe Verdi on the Italian operatic scene, and many of his operas appeared to be old fashioned and rarely, if ever, appeared outside of Italy.\" Pacini's work is largely forgotten today, although some recordings do exist.","opera_list":"Maria Regina d'Inghilterra"},{"composer":"Paul Hindemith","country_of_birth":"Germany","year_of_birth":"1895","death_of_birth":"1963","summary":"Paul Hindemith (16 November 1895 - 28 December 1963) was a German composer, violist, violinist, teacher, music theorist and conductor.Born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, Hindemith was taught the violin as a child.
